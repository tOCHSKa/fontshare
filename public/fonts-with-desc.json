    "description": "Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.\n\nUpdated July 2020: Upgraded to a variable font with Weight and Width axes, that closely match the previous static fonts released as two families, this one and a sibling Roboto Condensed family.\n\nRoboto is part of a superfamily set that includes Roboto Slab and Roboto Mono\n\nTo report issues or contribute, see github.com/TypeNetwork/Roboto.

Used for the Korean language. Created in 1446 by King Sejong the Great (Sejong of Joseon) as a simpler, phonetic alternative to using Chinese hanja for Korean. Not universally accepted for centuries, suppressed by Japanese colonial authorities. Since 1945 the standard script for Korean. The 51 basic letters (jamo) are grouped into syllable blocks depending on their position in the spoken syllable. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nLatin\nlink\n\nLatin (Roman) is a European bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right. The most popular writing system in the world. Used for over 3,000 languages including Latin and Romance languages (Italian, French, Portuguese, Spanish and Romanian), Germanic languages (English, Dutch, German, Nordic languages), Finnish, Malaysian, Indonesian, Filipino, Visayan languages, Turkish, Azerbaijani, Polish, Somali, Vietnamese, and many others. Derived from Western Greek, attested in Rome in the 7th century BCE. In the common era, numerous European languages adopted the Latin script along with Western Christian religion, the script disseminated further with European colonization of the Americas, Australia, parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific. New letters, ligatures and diacritical marks were gradually added to represent the sounds of various languages.

Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nEmoji symbols\nlink\n\nEmoji symbols are pictograms, logograms, ideograms and smileys used in electronic messages and web pages. Their primary function is to fill in emotional cues otherwise missing from typed conversation. They are typically rendered as multi-color characters. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, r12a.\n\nBopomofo\nlink\n\nBopomofo (注音符號, 注音符号, ㄅㄆㄇㄈ) is an East Asian syllabary, written left-to-right. Developed in 1913 in China to be used for Mandarin Chinese transliteration alongside the Latin-based Wade–Giles system. Also called Mandarin Phonetic Symbols or Zhuyin (注音). Bopomofo is an official transliteration system in Taiwan, used in dictionaries, books, newspapers and journals to annotate the Taiwanese pronunciation of Chinese Han characters, and in electronic input methods. Largely replaced by Pinyin romanization in the People’s Republic of China. Also used as the primary script for Taiwan’s minority languages like Atayal, Taroko, Paiwan and Yami. Has 21 onset consonants, 16 rhymes, and 4 tone marks. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nCyrillic\nlink\n\nCyrillic is a bicameral alphabet originating in Europe, written left-to-right (250 million users). Used for various languages across Eurasia and is used as the national script in various Slavic, Turkic, Mongolic and Iranic-speaking countries in Southeastern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, North Asia and East Asia, including Russian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Azerbaijani, Kazakh, Tajik, Kyrgyz, Bashkort, Chechen, Chuvash, Avar, Dargwa, Kabardian, Karakalpak, Kumyk, Lezgi, Ossetic, Pontic, Yakut, Buriat and many others. Created in the 9th century. Traditionally attributed to Saint Cyril, a monk from Thessaloniki working in Bulgaria, after earlier creation of the Glagolitic script. Sometimes attributed to Clement of Ohrid, a student of Saint Cyril’s. Initially used for Old Church Slavonic. Reformed in 1708 by Russian tsar Peter the Great. Extended by the Soviet Union in the 20th century to write over 50 languages throughout Eastern Europe and Asia (some of those languages switched to Latin after 1991). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nGreek\nlink\n\nGreek (Ελληνικά) is a European bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right (11 million users). Used to write the Greek language since the 8th century BCE. Also used to write other languages like Urum, Albanian Tosk, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish. Some symbols are also used in scientific notation. Derived from Phoenician. First “true alphabet”, with distinct letters for consonants and vowels. Standardized in the 4th century BCE by Eucleides. Has 24 letters. Some letter variants (sigma: σ/ς) have positional significance in the Greek language, other variants only differ in meaning in scientific notation (e.g. pi: π/ϖ). The Greek language used to be written in polytonic spelling, with three accents on vowels. In 1982, Greece introduced monotonic spelling with a single diacritic. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a."

    "description": "The old posters and signs in the traditional Montserrat neighborhood of Buenos Aires inspired Julieta Ulanovsky to design this typeface and rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century. As urban development changes that place, it will never return to its original form and loses forever the designs that are so special and unique. The letters that inspired this project have work, dedication, care, color, contrast, light and life, day and night! These are the types that make the city look so beautiful. The Montserrat Project began with the idea to rescue what is in Montserrat and set it free under a libre license, the SIL Open Font License.\n\nThis is the normal family, and it has two sister families so far, Alternates and Subrayada. Many of the letterforms are special in the Alternates family, while 'Subrayada' means 'Underlined' in Spanish and celebrates a special style of underline that is integrated into the letterforms found in the Montserrat neighborhood.\n\nUpdated November 2017: The family was redrawn by Jacques Le Bailly at Baron von Fonthausen over the summer, and the full set of weights were adjusted to make the Regular lighter and better for use in longer texts. In fall, Julieta Ulanovsky, Sol Matas, and Juan Pablo del Peral, led the development of Cyrillic support, with consultation with Carolina Giovagnoli, Maria Doreuli, and Alexei Vanyashin.\n\nThe Montserrat project is led by Julieta Ulanovsky, a type designer based in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

    "description": "Geometric sans serif typefaces have always been popular, and with support for both the Devanagari and Latin writing systems, Poppins is an internationalist addition to the genre.\n\nMany of the Latin glyphs (such as the ampersand) are more constructed and rationalist than is typical. The Devanagari design was particularly novel when it was first published in 2015, and was the first ever Devanagari typeface with a range of weights in this genre. Just like the Latin, the Devanagari is based on pure geometry, particularly circles.\n\nEach letterform is nearly monolinear, with optical corrections applied to stroke joints where necessary to maintain an even typographic color. The Devanagari base character height and the Latin ascender height are equal; Latin capital letters are shorter than the Devanagari characters, and the Latin x-height is set rather high.\n\nThe project was developed by Indian Type Foundry (ITF). The Devanagari was initially designed by Ninad Kale, while the Latin was initially designed by Jonny Pinhorn. Following their principal phase of designing the first 5 styles, the typeface was later refined, and expanded to include multiple weights and italics, by the ITF studio team.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/itfoundry/poppins"

    "description": "Lato means “Summer” in Polish, and it is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010 by Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic. Originally conceived as part of a corporate identity for a large client, the family became available for a public release when they decided to go in different stylistic direction.\n\nŁukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially conflicting priorities in the design; to create a typeface that seems “transparent” when used in body text but also displays original traits in larger size use. Classical proportions, particularly in the uppercase, give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance, and combine with a sleek treatement that feels contemporary without being trendy. Semi-rounded details feel warm, while the underlying structure provides stability and seriousness. “Serious but friendly, with the feeling of the Summer,” said Łukasz.\n\nLearn more at latofonts.com"

    "description": "Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.\n\nThis is the Condensed family, which can be used alongside the normal Roboto family and the Roboto Slab family.\n\nIn August 2023, the family has been upgraded to a variable font.\n\nTo contribute, please see github.com/googlefonts/roboto-classic."

    "description": "Roboto Mono is a monospaced addition to the Roboto type family. Like the other members of the Roboto family, the fonts are optimized for readability on screens across a wide variety of devices and reading environments. While the monospaced version is related to its variable width cousin, it doesn’t hesitate to change forms to better fit the constraints of a monospaced environment. For example, narrow glyphs like ‘I’, ‘l’ and ‘i’ have added serifs for more even texture while wider glyphs are adjusted for weight. Curved caps like ‘C’ and ‘O’ take on the straighter sides from Roboto Condensed.\n\nSpecial consideration is given to glyphs important for reading and writing software source code. Letters with similar shapes are easy to tell apart. Digit ‘1’, lowercase ‘l’ and capital ‘I’ are easily differentiated as are zero and the letter ‘O’. Punctuation important for code has also been considered. For example, the curly braces ‘{ }’ have exaggerated points to clearly differentiate them from parenthesis ‘( )’ and braces ‘[ ]’. Periods and commas are also exaggerated to identify them more quickly. The scale and weight of symbols commonly used as operators have also been optimized."

The characters of Oswald were initially re-drawn and reformed to better fit the pixel grid of standard digital screens. Oswald is designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.\n\n- Since the initial launch in 2011, Oswald was updated continually by Vernon Adams until 2014. Vernon added Light and Bold weights, support for more Latin and Cyrillic languages, tightened the spacing and kerning and made many glyph refinements throughout the family based on hundreds of users' feedback.\n- In 2016 the Latin part of the family was updated by Kalapi Gajjar to complete the work started by Vernon.\n- In January 2019, it was updated with a variable font Weight axis.\n- In July 2023, the font was upgraded with a Cyrillic character set expansion, and the rendering of math symbols was improved.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/OswaldFont"

Derived from Western Greek, attested in Rome in the 7th century BCE. In the common era, numerous European languages adopted the Latin script along with Western Christian religion, the script disseminated further with European colonization of the Americas, Australia, parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific. New letters, ligatures and diacritical marks were gradually added to represent the sounds of various languages. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nCyrillic\nlink\n\nCyrillic is a bicameral alphabet originating in Europe, written left-to-right (250 million users). Used for various languages across Eurasia and is used as the national script in various Slavic, Turkic, Mongolic and Iranic-speaking countries in Southeastern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, North Asia and East Asia, including Russian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Azerbaijani, Kazakh, Tajik, Kyrgyz, Bashkort, Chechen, Chuvash, Avar, Dargwa, Kabardian, Karakalpak, Kumyk, Lezgi, Ossetic, Pontic, Yakut, Buriat and many others. Created in the 9th century. Traditionally attributed to Saint Cyril, a monk from Thessaloniki working in Bulgaria, after earlier creation of the Glagolitic script. Sometimes attributed to Clement of Ohrid, a student of Saint Cyril’s. Initially used for Old Church Slavonic. Reformed in 1708 by Russian tsar Peter the Great. Extended by the Soviet Union in the 20th century to write over 50 languages throughout Eastern Europe and Asia (some of those languages switched to Latin after 1991).

Used to write the Greek language since the 8th century BCE. Also used to write other languages like Urum, Albanian Tosk, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish. Some symbols are also used in scientific notation. Derived from Phoenician. First “true alphabet”, with distinct letters for consonants and vowels. Standardized in the 4th century BCE by Eucleides. Has 24 letters. Some letter variants (sigma: σ/ς) have positional significance in the Greek language, other variants only differ in meaning in scientific notation (e.g. pi: π/ϖ). The Greek language used to be written in polytonic spelling, with three accents on vowels. In 1982, Greece introduced monotonic spelling with a single diacritic. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a."

    "description": "Playfair is a transitional design. In the European Enlightenment in the late 18th century, broad nib quills were replaced by pointed steel pens as the popular writing tool of the day. Together with developments in printing technology, ink, and paper making, it became fashionable to print letterforms of high contrast and delicate hairlines that were increasingly detached from the written letterforms. This design lends itself to this period, and while it is not a revival of any particular design, it takes influence from the designs of John Baskerville and from ‘Scotch Roman’ designs.\n\nThis typeface was initially published in 2011, and had a major update in 2017. Being a Display (large size) design in the transitional genre, functionally and stylistically it can accompany Georgia or Gelasio for body text. It was succeeded in 2023 by the complete Playfair design, which as a variable font includes body text designs in the optical size axis.\n\nThis is the main family, with a sibling Playfair Display SC small caps family. The main family downloaded font files include a full set of small caps, common ligatures, and discretionary ligatures.\n\nThe Playfair project is led by Claus Eggers Sørensen, a type designer based in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

    "description": "Noto Sans KR is an unmodulated (“sans serif”) design for the Korean language using Hangul and the Korean Hanja scripts. It also supports Hiragana, Katakana, Latin, Cyrillic and Greek.\n\nNoto Sans CJK KR contains 65,535 glyphs, 23 OpenType features, and supports 44,806 characters from 55 Unicode blocks: CJK Unified Ideographs, Hangul Syllables, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B, CJK Compatibility Ideographs, Hangul Jamo, CJK Compatibility, Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms, Kangxi Radicals, Enclosed CJK Letters and Months, Enclosed Alphanumeric Supplement, Box Drawing, CJK Radicals Supplement, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension E, Katakana, Hangul Compatibility Jamo, Hiragana, Latin Extended Additional, Latin-1 Supplement, Basic Latin, Enclosed Alphanumerics, Mathematical Operators, Hangul Jamo Extended-B, Cyrillic, Enclosed Ideographic Supplement, CJK Compatibility Ideographs Supplement, CJK Symbols and Punctuation, Miscellaneous Symbols, Greek and Coptic, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension C, Bopomofo, Geometric Shapes, CJK Strokes, General Punctuation, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension D, Block Elements, CJK Compatibility Forms, Latin Extended-A, Hangul Jamo Extended-A, Bopomofo Extended, Miscellaneous Technical, Small Form Variants, Arrows, Latin Extended-B, Letterlike Symbols, Katakana Phonetic Extensions, Kanbun, Ideographic Description Characters, Vertical Forms, Spacing Modifier Letters, Dingbats, Combining Diacritical Marks, Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows, Alphabetic Presentation Forms, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension F.\n\nSupported writing systems\nlink\nKorean Hanja\nlink\n\nKorean Hanja (한자, 漢字) is an East Asian logo-syllabary, written left-to-right. Based on traditional Chinese Han characters, Hanja was used for the Korean language until 1446, when King Sejong introduced Hangul. Until the mid-20th century Hanja and Hangul were used in parallel or mixed. Today, the vast majority of Korean text uses Hangul but Hanja is still used in some context, and schools teach some 1,000-3,000 Hanja symbols. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nHangul\nlink\n\nHangul (Hangeul, 한글, Chosŏn'gŭl, 조선글) is an East Asian script, written vertically right-to-left and horizontally left-to-right (79 million users). Used for the Korean language. Created in 1446 by King Sejong the Great (Sejong of Joseon) as a simpler, phonetic alternative to using Chinese hanja for Korean. Not universally accepted for centuries, suppressed by Japanese colonial authorities. Since 1945 the standard script for Korean. The 51 basic letters (jamo) are grouped into syllable blocks depending on their position in the spoken syllable. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nLatin\nlink\n\nLatin (Roman) is a European bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right. The most popular writing system in the world. Used for over 3,000 languages including Latin and Romance languages (Italian, French, Portuguese, Spanish and Romanian), Germanic languages (English, Dutch, German, Nordic languages), Finnish, Malaysian, Indonesian, Filipino, Visayan languages, Turkish, Azerbaijani, Polish, Somali, Vietnamese, and many others. Derived from Western Greek, attested in Rome in the 7th century BCE. In the common era, numerous European languages adopted the Latin script along with Western Christian religion, the script disseminated further with European colonization of the Americas, Australia, parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific. New letters, ligatures and diacritical marks were gradually added to represent the sounds of various languages. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nKatakana\nlink\n\nKatakana (片仮名、カタカナ) is an East Asian syllabary, written vertically right-to-left and horizontally left-to-right (126 million users). Used in Japan for Japanese, Ryukyuan, Ainu and Palauan, and formerly for Taiwanese Hokkien. Katakana is used for transcription of foreign-language words into Japanese, for the writing of loan words, for emphasis, to represent onomatopoeia, for technical and scientific terms, for names of plants, animals and minerals, and often for names of Japanese companies. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nHiragana\nlink\n\nHiragana (平仮名, ひらがな) is an East Asian syllabary, written vertically right-to-left and horizontally left-to-right (120 million users). Used in Japan for Japanese and the Ryukyuan languages. Hiragana is used to write okurigana (kana suffixes following a kanji root, for example to inflect verbs and adjectives), various grammatical and function words including particles, as well as miscellaneous other native words for which there are no kanji or whose kanji form is obscure or too formal for the writing purpose. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nEmoji symbols\nlink\n\nEmoji symbols are pictograms, logograms, ideograms and smileys used in electronic messages and web pages. Their primary function is to fill in emotional cues otherwise missing from typed conversation. They are typically rendered as multi-color characters. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, r12a.\n\nBopomofo\nlink\n\nBopomofo (注音符號, 注音符号, ㄅㄆㄇㄈ) is an East Asian syllabary, written left-to-right. Developed in 1913 in China to be used for Mandarin Chinese transliteration alongside the Latin-based Wade–Giles system. Also called Mandarin Phonetic Symbols or Zhuyin (注音). Bopomofo is an official transliteration system in Taiwan, used in dictionaries, books, newspapers and journals to annotate the Taiwanese pronunciation of Chinese Han characters, and in electronic input methods. Largely replaced by Pinyin romanization in the People’s Republic of China. Also used as the primary script for Taiwan’s minority languages like Atayal, Taroko, Paiwan and Yami. Has 21 onset consonants, 16 rhymes, and 4 tone marks. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nCyrillic\nlink\n\nCyrillic is a bicameral alphabet originating in Europe, written left-to-right (250 million users). Used for various languages across Eurasia and is used as the national script in various Slavic, Turkic, Mongolic and Iranic-speaking countries in Southeastern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, North Asia and East Asia, including Russian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Azerbaijani, Kazakh, Tajik, Kyrgyz, Bashkort, Chechen, Chuvash, Avar, Dargwa, Kabardian, Karakalpak, Kumyk, Lezgi, Ossetic, Pontic, Yakut, Buriat and many others. Created in the 9th century. Traditionally attributed to Saint Cyril, a monk from Thessaloniki working in Bulgaria, after earlier creation of the Glagolitic script. Sometimes attributed to Clement of Ohrid, a student of Saint Cyril’s. Initially used for Old Church Slavonic. Reformed in 1708 by Russian tsar Peter the Great. Extended by the Soviet Union in the 20th century to write over 50 languages throughout Eastern Europe and Asia (some of those languages switched to Latin after 1991). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nGreek\nlink\n\nGreek (Ελληνικά) is a European bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right (11 million users). Used to write the Greek language since the 8th century BCE. Also used to write other languages like Urum, Albanian Tosk, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish. Some symbols are also used in scientific notation. Derived from Phoenician. First “true alphabet”, with distinct letters for consonants and vowels. Standardized in the 4th century BCE by Eucleides. Has 24 letters. Some letter variants (sigma: σ/ς) have positional significance in the Greek language, other variants only differ in meaning in scientific notation (e.g. pi: π/ϖ). The Greek language used to be written in polytonic spelling, with three accents on vowels. In 1982, Greece introduced monotonic spelling with a single diacritic. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a."

While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.\n\nThis is the Roboto Slab family, which can be used alongside the normal Roboto family and the Roboto Condensed family.\n\nIn November 2019, the family was updated with a variable font \"Weight\" axis.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/robotoslab."

It was given financial support from the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications.\n\nThe fonts include standard Western, Central European and Cyrillic code pages, plus the characters of every title language in the Russian Federation. This makes them a unique and very important tool for modern digital communications.\n\nPT Sans is based on Russian sans serif types of the second part of the 20th century, but at the same time has distinctive features of contemporary humanistic designs. The family consists of 8 styles: 4 basic styles, 2 captions styles for small sizes, and 2 narrows styles for economic type setting.\n\nDesigned by Alexandra Korolkova, Olga Umpeleva and Vladimir Yefimov and released by ParaType in 2009."

    "description": "Kanit means mathematics in Thai, and the Kanit typeface family is a formal Loopless Thai and Sans Latin design. It is a combination of concepts, mixing a Humanist Sans Serif motif with the curves of Capsulated Geometric styles that makes it suitable for various uses, contemporary and futuristic. A notable detail is that the stroke terminals have flat angles, which allows the design to enjoy decreased spacing between letters while preserving readability and legibility at smaller point sizes.\n\nIn Thai typeface design the formal loopless Thai typefaces have more simple forms than the conservative looped Thai designs, and this simplification has to be done properly in order to preserve the essential character of each letter. Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall textures. When designing Kanit, special care was taken with some groups of letters such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, and ข ช to ensure they are distinct and legible, because it might lead to confusion if each glyph is not clear enough.\n\nKanit is the first Thai font family to be hinted with TTFAutohint, an easy-to-use hinting tool that is highly recommended.\n\nThe Kanit project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand.

The Regular weight and others in the middle of the family are optimised for on-screen text usage at medium-sizes (14px-48px) and can also be used in print design. The fonts closer to the extreme weights are designed more for display use both on the web and in print. Overall, features are simplified and optimised for screen resolutions; for example, diacritic marks are larger than how they would be in print. A version optimised for desktop applications is available from the Work Sans github project page.\n\nThe Work Sans project is led by Wei Huang, a type designer from Australia. To contribute, see github.com/weiweihuanghuang/Work-Sans\n\nUpdated August 2015: All styles were updated to v1.40 to change the Thin (100) style to be the same as 'HairLine' in previous versions - even thinner! This avoids the complication of a second \"Hairline\" family. The ExtraLight (200) and Light (300) styles also changed accordingly. Reflow will occur from previous versions on these weights.\n\nUpdated February 2020: Family has been upgraded to a variable font family."

In 2019, Mirko Velimirovic converted the family into a variable font.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/andrew-paglinawan/QuicksandFamily."

Used for the Korean language. Created in 1446 by King Sejong the Great (Sejong of Joseon) as a simpler, phonetic alternative to using Chinese hanja for Korean. Not universally accepted for centuries, suppressed by Japanese colonial authorities. Since 1945 the standard script for Korean. The 51 basic letters (jamo) are grouped into syllable blocks depending on their position in the spoken syllable. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nLatin\nlink\n\nLatin (Roman) is a European bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right. The most popular writing system in the world. Used for over 3,000 languages including Latin and Romance languages (Italian, French, Portuguese, Spanish and Romanian), Germanic languages (English, Dutch, German, Nordic languages), Finnish, Malaysian, Indonesian, Filipino, Visayan languages, Turkish, Azerbaijani, Polish, Somali, Vietnamese, and many others. Derived from Western Greek, attested in Rome in the 7th century BCE. In the common era, numerous European languages adopted the Latin script along with Western Christian religion, the script disseminated further with European colonization of the Americas, Australia, parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific. New letters, ligatures and diacritical marks were gradually added to represent the sounds of various languages.

Used in Japan for Japanese, Ryukyuan, Ainu and Palauan, and formerly for Taiwanese Hokkien. Katakana is used for transcription of foreign-language words into Japanese, for the writing of loan words, for emphasis, to represent onomatopoeia, for technical and scientific terms, for names of plants, animals and minerals, and often for names of Japanese companies.

Used in Japan for Japanese and the Ryukyuan languages. Hiragana is used to write okurigana (kana suffixes following a kanji root, for example to inflect verbs and adjectives), various grammatical and function words including particles, as well as miscellaneous other native words for which there are no kanji or whose kanji form is obscure or too formal for the writing purpose. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nEmoji symbols\nlink\n\nEmoji symbols are pictograms, logograms, ideograms and smileys used in electronic messages and web pages. Their primary function is to fill in emotional cues otherwise missing from typed conversation. They are typically rendered as multi-color characters. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, r12a.\n\nBopomofo\nlink\n\nBopomofo (注音符號, 注音符号, ㄅㄆㄇㄈ) is an East Asian syllabary, written left-to-right. Developed in 1913 in China to be used for Mandarin Chinese transliteration alongside the Latin-based Wade–Giles system. Also called Mandarin Phonetic Symbols or Zhuyin (注音). Bopomofo is an official transliteration system in Taiwan, used in dictionaries, books, newspapers and journals to annotate the Taiwanese pronunciation of Chinese Han characters, and in electronic input methods. Largely replaced by Pinyin romanization in the People’s Republic of China. Also used as the primary script for Taiwan’s minority languages like Atayal, Taroko, Paiwan and Yami. Has 21 onset consonants, 16 rhymes, and 4 tone marks. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nCyrillic\nlink\n\nCyrillic is a bicameral alphabet originating in Europe, written left-to-right (250 million users). Used for various languages across Eurasia and is used as the national script in various Slavic, Turkic, Mongolic and Iranic-speaking countries in Southeastern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, North Asia and East Asia, including Russian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Azerbaijani, Kazakh, Tajik, Kyrgyz, Bashkort, Chechen, Chuvash, Avar, Dargwa, Kabardian, Karakalpak, Kumyk, Lezgi, Ossetic, Pontic, Yakut, Buriat and many others. Created in the 9th century. Traditionally attributed to Saint Cyril, a monk from Thessaloniki working in Bulgaria, after earlier creation of the Glagolitic script. Sometimes attributed to Clement of Ohrid, a student of Saint Cyril’s. Initially used for Old Church Slavonic. Reformed in 1708 by Russian tsar Peter the Great. Extended by the Soviet Union in the 20th century to write over 50 languages throughout Eastern Europe and Asia (some of those languages switched to Latin after 1991). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nGreek\nlink\n\nGreek (Ελληνικά) is a European bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right (11 million users). Used to write the Greek language since the 8th century BCE. Also used to write other languages like Urum, Albanian Tosk, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish. Some symbols are also used in scientific notation. Derived from Phoenician. First “true alphabet”, with distinct letters for consonants and vowels. Standardized in the 4th century BCE by Eucleides. Has 24 letters. Some letter variants (sigma: σ/ς) have positional significance in the Greek language, other variants only differ in meaning in scientific notation (e.g. pi: π/ϖ). The Greek language used to be written in polytonic spelling, with three accents on vowels. In 1982, Greece introduced monotonic spelling with a single diacritic. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a."

Any type designer interested in the amendment or revision of Titillium is invited to co-operate with us, or develop their own variants of the typeface according to the terms specified in the Open Font license. We also ask all graphic designers who use Titillium in their projects to email us some examples of the typeface family in use, in order to prepare a case histories database.\n\nThree years after the birth of Titillium, the project is still evolving, and even we don’t know what it will become in the future.\n\nSpecial thanks go to:\nProf. Luciano Perondi, design and curation\nProf. Marcello Signorile, coordination\nProf. Manuel Zanettin, web project supervision\nDiego Giusti, design of the first prototype"

Plex was designed to capture IBM’s spirit and history, and to illustrate the unique relationship between mankind and machine—a principal theme for IBM since the turn of the century. The result is a neutral, yet friendly Grotesque style typeface that includes a Sans, Sans Condensed, Mono, Serif, and several other styles for several languages, and has excellent legibility in print, web and mobile interfaces. Plex’s three designs work well independently, and even better together. Use the Sans as a contemporary compadre, the Serif for editorial storytelling, or the Mono to show code snippets. The unexpectedly expressive nature of the italics give you even more options for your designs.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/plex."

There are a great many “programmer fonts,” designed primarily for use on the screen, but in most cases do not have the attention to detail for high resolution rendering.\n\nInconsolata draws from many inspirations and sources. I was particularly struck by the beauty of Luc(as) de Groot's Consolas, which is his monospaced design for Microsoft's Vista release. This font, similar to his earlier TheSansMono, demonstrated clearly to me that monospaced fonts do not have to suck.\n\nThe development of the Regular style by Raph Levien was started in 2006 using his own Spiro-based tools and FontForge. The Bold style was designed by Kirill Tkachev and the Cyreal foundry in 2012.\n\nUpdated September 2015: Internal metadata corrected.\n\nUpdated April 2020: Family has been upgraded to a variable font family.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/inconsolata."

It was given financial support from the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications.\n\nThe fonts include standard Western, Central European and Cyrillic code pages, plus the characters of every title language in the Russian Federation. This makes them a unique and very important tool for modern digital communications.\n\nPT Serif is a transitional serif typeface with humanistic terminals. It is designed for use together with PT Sans, and is harmonized across metrics, proportions, weights and design.\n\nThe family consists of six styles: regular and bold weights with corresponding italics form a standard font family for basic text setting; two caption styles in regular and italic are for use in small point sizes.\n\nDesigned by Alexandra Korolkova, Olga Umpeleva and Vladimir Yefimov and released by ParaType in 2010."

    "description": "IBM Plex® is the corporate typeface for IBM worldwide and an open-source project developed by the IBM Brand & Experience team (BX&D). Plex is an international typeface family designed to capture IBM’s brand spirit and history and to illustrate the unique relationship between mankind and machine—a principal theme for IBM since the turn of the century. The result is a neutral yet friendly Grotesque style typeface that balances design with the engineered details that make Plex distinctly IBM. The family includes a Sans, Sans Condensed, Mono, and Serif and has excellent legibility in print, web, and mobile interfaces.\n\nPlex’s three designs work well independently and even better together. Use the Sans as a contemporary compadre, the Serif for editorial storytelling, or the Mono to show code snippets. The unexpectedly expressive nature of the italics gives you even more options for your designs. Currently, IBM Plex Sans supports Extended Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean and Thai."

The most popular writing system in the world. Used for over 3,000 languages including Latin and Romance languages (Italian, French, Portuguese, Spanish and Romanian), Germanic languages (English, Dutch, German, Nordic languages), Finnish, Malaysian, Indonesian, Filipino, Visayan languages, Turkish, Azerbaijani, Polish, Somali, Vietnamese, and many others. Derived from Western Greek, attested in Rome in the 7th century BCE. In the common era, numerous European languages adopted the Latin script along with Western Christian religion, the script disseminated further with European colonization of the Americas, Australia, parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific. New letters, ligatures and diacritical marks were gradually added to represent the sounds of various languages. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nCyrillic\nlink\n\nCyrillic is a bicameral alphabet originating in Europe, written left-to-right (250 million users). Used for various languages across Eurasia and is used as the national script in various Slavic, Turkic, Mongolic and Iranic-speaking countries in Southeastern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, North Asia and East Asia, including Russian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Azerbaijani, Kazakh, Tajik, Kyrgyz, Bashkort, Chechen, Chuvash, Avar, Dargwa, Kabardian, Karakalpak, Kumyk, Lezgi, Ossetic, Pontic, Yakut, Buriat and many others. Created in the 9th century. Traditionally attributed to Saint Cyril, a monk from Thessaloniki working in Bulgaria, after earlier creation of the Glagolitic script. Sometimes attributed to Clement of Ohrid, a student of Saint Cyril’s. Initially used for Old Church Slavonic. Reformed in 1708 by Russian tsar Peter the Great. Extended by the Soviet Union in the 20th century to write over 50 languages throughout Eastern Europe and Asia (some of those languages switched to Latin after 1991). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nGreek\nlink\n\nGreek (Ελληνικά) is a European bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right (11 million users). Used to write the Greek language since the 8th century BCE. Also used to write other languages like Urum, Albanian Tosk, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish. Some symbols are also used in scientific notation. Derived from Phoenician. First “true alphabet”, with distinct letters for consonants and vowels. Standardized in the 4th century BCE by Eucleides. Has 24 letters. Some letter variants (sigma: σ/ς) have positional significance in the Greek language, other variants only differ in meaning in scientific notation (e.g. pi: π/ϖ). The Greek language used to be written in polytonic spelling, with three accents on vowels. In 1982, Greece introduced monotonic spelling with a single diacritic. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a."

Hunt as a companion to Source Sans.This complementary family was adapted from the Source design due to a request to create a monospaced version for coding applications. Source Code preserves the design features and vertical proportions of Source Sans, but alters the glyph widths so that they are uniform across all glyphs and weights.\n\nAlthough this family was designed specifically for coding environments, for which a regular weight will typically suffice, Source Code has been made available in the same weight range as the corresponding Source Sans design.Source Code Pro currently supports a wide range of languages using the Latin script, and includes all the characters in the Adobe Latin 4 glyph set.\n\nAs an open source project, it is expected that incremental updates will be made over time to extend glyph set coverage and functionality. In 2019, we have updated the family to Roman v2.030 and Italic v1.050. This update now supports Greek, Cyrillic, Vietnamese and Italic styles.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro."

    "description": "Hind Siliguri is a family of five Bengali fonts, which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. Hind Multi-Script is a type system providing nine stylistically-matching font families – one for each of the following writing systems used in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka: Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, and Sinhala. In addition to Bengali, the Hind Siliguri fonts also include Latin-script characters.\n\nDeveloped explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. Most of these strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. Additionally, Hind’s letterforms feature open apertures. The entire family feels very legible when used to set text.\n\nThe Bengali and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that the Bengali headline is more or less at the same visual height as the Latin capital letters share. The exact height of the Bengali headline increases vis à vis the capital height as the family increases in weight, just as the Latin lowercase does. Each font in the Hind Siliguri family has 820 glyphs, including many unique Bengali conjuncts. These ensure support for the languages written with the Bengali script. The Latin component’s character set is Adobe Latin 3, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western European languages.\n\nHind Siliguri is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding. Jyotish Sonowal designed Hind Siliguri for ITF, who first published the fonts in 2015. Hind Siliguri is named after Siliguri, a city in West Bengal, India.\n\nThe Hind Siliguri project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India.

Developed in 1913 in China to be used for Mandarin Chinese transliteration alongside the Latin-based Wade–Giles system. Also called Mandarin Phonetic Symbols or Zhuyin (注音). Bopomofo is an official transliteration system in Taiwan, used in dictionaries, books, newspapers and journals to annotate the Taiwanese pronunciation of Chinese Han characters, and in electronic input methods. Largely replaced by Pinyin romanization in the People’s Republic of China. Also used as the primary script for Taiwan’s minority languages like Atayal, Taroko, Paiwan and Yami. Has 21 onset consonants, 16 rhymes, and 4 tone marks.

Used for various languages across Eurasia and is used as the national script in various Slavic, Turkic, Mongolic and Iranic-speaking countries in Southeastern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, North Asia and East Asia, including Russian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Azerbaijani, Kazakh, Tajik, Kyrgyz, Bashkort, Chechen, Chuvash, Avar, Dargwa, Kabardian, Karakalpak, Kumyk, Lezgi, Ossetic, Pontic, Yakut, Buriat and many others. Created in the 9th century. Traditionally attributed to Saint Cyril, a monk from Thessaloniki working in Bulgaria, after earlier creation of the Glagolitic script. Sometimes attributed to Clement of Ohrid, a student of Saint Cyril’s. Initially used for Old Church Slavonic. Reformed in 1708 by Russian tsar Peter the Great. Extended by the Soviet Union in the 20th century to write over 50 languages throughout Eastern Europe and Asia (some of those languages switched to Latin after 1991). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nGreek\nlink\n\nGreek (Ελληνικά) is a European bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right (11 million users). Used to write the Greek language since the 8th century BCE. Also used to write other languages like Urum, Albanian Tosk, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish. Some symbols are also used in scientific notation. Derived from Phoenician. First “true alphabet”, with distinct letters for consonants and vowels. Standardized in the 4th century BCE by Eucleides. Has 24 letters. Some letter variants (sigma: σ/ς) have positional significance in the Greek language, other variants only differ in meaning in scientific notation (e.g. pi: π/ϖ). The Greek language used to be written in polytonic spelling, with three accents on vowels. In 1982, Greece introduced monotonic spelling with a single diacritic. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a."

Cabin incorporates modern proportions, optical adjustments, and some elements of the geometric sans. It remains true to its roots, but has its own personality.\n\nThe Cabin font family comes in two variable fonts, roman and true italic, with a Weight range from Regular to Bold, and a Width range from normal to Condensed. The stroke contrast is almost monolinear, although top and bottom curves are slightly thinned. Counters of the b, g, p and q are rounded, and all are optically adjusted.\n\nCabin has wide language support, including full Latin coverage of Vietnamese, additional to all Western, Central, and South/Eastern European languages.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/impallari/Cabin"

    "description": "EB Garamond is intended to be an excellent, classical, Garamond. It is a community project to create a revival of Claude Garamont’s famous humanist typefaces from the mid-16th century. This digital version reproduces the original design by Claude Garamont closely: The source for the letterforms is a scan of a specimen known as the “Berner specimen,” which was composed in 1592 by Conrad Berner, the son-in-law of Christian Egenolff and his successor at the Egenolff print office. This specimen shows Garamont’s roman and Granjon’s italic types at different sizes. Hence the name of this project: Egenolff-Berner Garamond.\n\nWhy another Garamond? That typeface is a key moment in the history of typography, and European type designers have been reacting to this work ever since. It is probably the most revived typeface in the world and many are excellent. In the world of free/libre culture, however, only a few Garamond-inspired types exist, and none share the scope of this project.\n\nIn November 2019, the family has been updated to a variable font family.\n\nThis project is led by Georg Duffner, and developed at github.com/georgd/EB-Garamond"

Derived from Western Greek, attested in Rome in the 7th century BCE. In the common era, numerous European languages adopted the Latin script along with Western Christian religion, the script disseminated further with European colonization of the Americas, Australia, parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific.

The goal is to build one harmonious family across all Indian scripts without letting the visual features of one script dominate over others. This ensures that the fonts can be used successfully for both single and multi-script purposes.\n\nMukta was designed by Girish Dalvi and Yashodeep Gholap. Mukta Vaani was designed by Noopur Datye and Pallavi Karambelkar with support from Sarang Kulkarni and Maithili Shingre. Mukta Malar was designed by Aadarsh Rajan. Mukta Mahee was designed by Shuchita Grover and Noopur Datye.\n\nEk would like to thank Vinay Saynekar, Santosh Kshirsagar, Shubhanand Jog, Yogesh Jahargirdar, Pradnya Naik, Snehal Patil, Omkar Shende and Dave Crossland for their suggestions and feedback during the font design process. Ek would also like to thank faculty and friends from the Industrial Design Centre, IIT Bombay, and from Sir J J Institute of Applied Art, for their support and encouragement.\n\nThis project is led by Ek Type, a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces.

    "description": "Prompt in Thai means “ready,” the same as in English. Prompt is a loopless Thai and sans Latin typeface. The simple and geometric Latin was developed to work harmoniously with the loopless Thai that has wide proportions and airy negative space. It is suitable for both web and print usage, such as magazines, newspapers, and posters.\n\nA similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. Formal loopless Thai typefaces are simplified, compared to traditional looped Thai types, and this simplification has to be done properly in order to preserve the essense of each character. The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks has been managed carefully, because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.\n\nThe Prompt project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand.

    "description": "People read and interact with text on screens more and more each day. What happens on screen ends up being more important than what comes out of the printer. With the accelerating popularity of electronic books, type designers are working hard to seek out the ideal designs for reading on screen.\n\nMotivated by her love for the pixel, Sol Matas designed Bitter. A \"contemporary\" slab serif typeface for text, it is specially designed for comfortably reading on any computer or device. The robust design started from the austerity of the pixel grid, based on rational rather than emotional principles. It combines the large x-heights and legibility of the humanistic tradition with subtle characteristics in the characters that inject a certain rhythm to flowing texts.\n\nBitter has little variation in stroke weight and the Regular style is thicker than a usual ‘Regular’ style for print design. This generates an intense color in paragraphs, accentuated by the serifs that are as thick as strokes with square terminals.\n\nEach glyph is carefully designed with an excellent curve quality added to the first stage of the design, that was entirely made in a pixel grid. The typeface is balanced and manually spaced to use very few kerning pairs.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/solmatas/BitterPro ."

The fonts were originally commissioned by 6616 Studio for Jakarta Provincial Government program's +Jakarta City of Collaboration identity in 2020.\n\nTaking inspiration in Neuzeit Grotesk, Futura, and 1930s grotesque sans serifs with almost monolinear contrast and pointy curves, the fonts consist of modern and clean cut forms, the x-height dimension slightly taller to provide clear spaces between caps and x-height, and also equipped with open counters and balanced spaces to preserve the legibility at a large range of sizes.\n\nThe beauty of diversity captured in typography. Like the city itself, the uniqueness of this font is that in some glyphs it has its own diversity and characteristic of various explorations of forms that enrich the expressions and stories that coexist. The charms of Plus Jakarta Sans fonts appear when one looks closer, manifesting in a beauty that emerges once seen as a whole. Each alternate in the family contains several alternative characters, divided into three stylistic sets which Lancip (Sharp), Lurus (Straight), and Lingkar (Swirl).\n\nAs part of +Jakarta City of Collaboration, the fonts are made available for public use under the SIL Open Font License.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/tokotype/PlusJakartaSans."

This font family has been created for use in headlines and other display-sized text on screen. Five font styles make up the initial release.\n\nDisplay families with extensive character sets are rare for any script. With Indian typefaces, however, large character sets are even less common. ITF’s designs are an exception. The Teko typeface features letterforms with low stroke contrast, square proportions and a structure that appears visually simple.\n\nThe Regular, Medium and Semibold fonts are recommended for use in long headlines, while Bold is intended primarily for setting just one or two words. The Light is a beautiful variant that may be put to exceptionally good use in large headlines on websites. At display sizes, Teko works equally well on screen or in print. Each font contains 1090 glyphs, offering full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written with the Devanagari script. Teko is an excellent choice for use in advertising or for news tickers on television screens (breaking news, etc.)\n\nManushi Parikh designed the Teko typeface for the Indian Type Foundry, who published it in 2014.\n\nIn 2023, Marc Foley converted the family to a variable font.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/teko."

    "description": "Watch the introduction video on YouTube\n\nThere’s no perfect typeface that works for every size, every device, every application, every style, and every mood. But as the default for Android, with over 2.5 billion active users spanning over 190 countries, and as Google Fonts’ most popular download, Roboto needs to be as flexible as possible.\n\nThe Roboto superfamily has grown over time, being updated over the years to improve its language support and aesthetic qualities. Initially launched in 2011 as sans and condensed with slab and mono companions, and expanded with Roboto Serif, Roboto Flex is the latest step forward for this powerful typeface system.\n\nRoboto Flex is Google Fonts’ biggest project to date. With a huge range of weights and widths across a full set of optical sizes, plus additional capabilities for fine-tuning, Roboto Flex was designed by Font Bureau to be super scalable, adaptable, customizable, and optimizable.\n\nWith Flex, you can customize Roboto to express and finesse your text in ways never before possible. Today, people are constantly switching between devices, resizing browsers, and spreading our viewports across multiple screens. So Google commissioned Font Bureau to re-imagine Roboto to “flex” along with us, with a special emphasis on large-screen capabilities. This was achieved by amplifying the original design to an extreme range of weights, grades, widths and optical sizes.\n\nThe second benefit of Roboto Flex is the designer’s ability to fitness and fine-tune their designs with parametric axes. Font Bureau first demonstrated the concept of parametric axes in Amstelvar Alpha (2017), to provide the ultimate in typographic flexibility. With early prototypes of Roboto Flex, Font Bureau demonstrated new solutions to the typographic problems that digital designers face. Demonstrations of high quality justification, better dark-mode typography and other uses of parametric axes are documented at variablefonts.typenetwork.com\n\nThe needs of developers, designers, and — of course — end-user readers were prioritized and aligned during development. To make Roboto Flex production-ready for all print and digital media, Font Bureau expanded the glyph set with careful planning and development, in partnership with script experts for Cyrillic and Greek. Rigorous testing of each glyph across every axis required new type design tools to be developed, like typeroof, which can be used to explore the depth of the design.\n\nThe final file size of the complete package is remarkably small, given the range of expressive styles now available. By driving variable fonts technology to its limits, it offers the most interesting and useful typographic tools for end users and designers. With a fully loaded Optical Size axis, Roboto Flex makes the layout of texts with deep hierarchies more straightforward and heightens the quality of every design that uses it.\n\nAnd none of this would be possible without the long list of contributors involved. Special thanks to David Berlow, Santiago Orozco, Ilya Ruderman, Irene Vlachou, Yury Ostromentsky, Mikhail Strukov, Dave Crossland, Damien Correll, Marc Foley, David Jonathan Ross, Chris Lewis, Eben Sorkin, Viktoriya Grabowska, Adam Twardoch, Roel Nieksens, Laurence Penney, and Thomas Linard.\n\nRoboto Flex is developed by Font Bureau for Google, based on the design initiated by Christian Robertson.

    "description": "Hind is an Open Source typeface supporting the Devanagari and Latin scripts. Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, the Hind font family includes five styles. Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, which is paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. Most of these strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. In addition to this, Hind’s letterforms feature open apertures. The entire typeface family feels very legible when used to set text.\n\nThe Devanagari and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that the Devanagari headline falls just below the Latin capital-height. In other words, the Devanagari base characters are 94% as tall as the Latin uppercase. Text set in the Devanagari script sits nicely alongside the Latin lowercase, too. Hind’s Devanagari vowel marks take forms that tends toward the traditional end of the design spectrum, while the knotted terminals inside of the base characters feature a treatment that appears more contemporary.\n\nEach font in the Hind family has 1146 glyphs, which include hundreds of unique Devanagari conjuncts. These ensure full support for the major languages written with the Devanagari script. The Latin component’s character set is a basic western one, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western European languages. Hind is a solid choice for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding.\n\nManushi Parikh designed Hind for the Indian Type Foundry, who first published the fonts in 2014.\n\nThe Hind project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India.

The fonts were originally commissioned by Paula Scher, Pentagram and designed by Jeremy Mickel, MCKL for the new Red Hat identity.\n\nRed Hat is a fresh take on the geometric sans genre, taking inspiration from a range of American sans serifs including Tempo and Highway Gothic. The Display styles are low contrast and spaced tightly, with a large x-height and open counters. The Text styles have a slightly smaller x-height and narrower width for better legibility, are spaced more generously, and have thinned joins for better performance at small sizes. The two families can be used together seamlessly at a range of sizes.\n\nThe family has been upgraded to variable fonts with a weight axis (Light to Bold) in June 2021.\n\nThe November 2024 update addresses a frequently reported weight issue. The Medium and SemiBold weights now have slightly different weight compared to the previous version, ensuring better weight distribution within the design space and improved fluidity in the variable font.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/RedHatOfficial/RedHatFont"

    "description": "Lexend fonts are intended to reduce visual stress and so improve reading performance. Initially they were designed with dyslexia and struggling readers in mind, but Bonnie Shaver-Troup, creator of the Lexend project, soon found out that these fonts are also great for everyone else.\n\nThe first set of Lexend fonts by Thomas Jockin ( Deca, Exa, Giga, Mega, Peta, Tera, Zetta) becomes wider and more openly spaced (also known as \"tracked out\"). This new version of Lexend is a variable font with a weight axis.\n\nPlease note that the initial release of this font had a lighter Regular weight. It has been decided for the update of July 2021 to align the Regular weight with the one of Lexend Deca which is slightly bolder. Lexend and Lexend Deca are therefore the same (for now…). Ultimately this version will offer a HyperExpansion axis which will allow variation of inner and outer space of letterforms.\n\nTrue to Bonnie’s vision, Lexend fonts are freely available for all since 2019 in Google Fonts.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/lexend. For more information, see lexend.com.\n\nClean and clear: making reading easier with Lexend\nlink\n\nA key factor in reading problems might be hiding in plain sight. Learn how changing fonts can change comprehension.\n\nA child struggles to read and understand their homework assignment. An adult re-reads a news article and still doesn’t understand what it’s about. Both readers end up frustrated and feeling like there is something wrong with them. Thankfully there might be a simple answer. Dr. Bonnie Shaver-Troup thinks fonts are part of the problem and the solution to many reading problems.\n\n“We have a global reading crisis and we can change much of it by delivering fonts that are optimized for the visual field and for the individual. The answer is hidden in plain sight. It’s the font,” said Shaver-Troup.\n\nChange the font, change the outcome\nlink\n\nWhile working as an educational therapist in Silicon Valley, Shaver-Troup helped students with dyslexia and other reading problems to learn to read. She experimented by changing the spacing between certain letters in their reading assignments, and found that it improved their reading and comprehension. According to Shaver-Troup, the issue wasn’t in her students’ minds, it was with the letterforms they saw on the screen or paper.\n\n“The majority of the reading problems, including dyslexia, are not cognitive or phonological. They are visual or perceptual. Our testing has a built-in design flaw. We use fonts to deliver text for reading that are too tight for efficient or successful visual processing. Then we get poor results, suggesting the reading issue is phonological or cognitive. If we change the font to the tested optimized font fit, then we change the outcome,” she explained.\n\nTo learn more, read:\nClean and clear: making reading easier with Lexend (English)\nPartnering to change how the world reads (English)\nEine Partnerschaft mit dem Ziel, das Leseerlebnis weltweit zu verändern: Erweiterung von Lexend um verschiedene Schriftstärken (German)"

For an illustrated presentation and description of the family, please visit its Bēhance page.\n\nWhile this project was heavily inspired by Claude Garamont's immortal legacy, Christian did not use any specific font as a starting point or direct reference for the designs. Most glyphs were drawn from scratch; when he needed guidance on a specific character, he searched for the term Garamond and skimmed through the results for a general impression.\n\nHe is grateful to the creative souls on the Typophile, TypeDrawers and Typografie forums, and Github, for a wealth of knowledge about type design, and for providing a large amount of excellent feedback on Cormorant during its development. He also thanks the tireless folks at Glyphs, in particular Rainer Erich Scheichelbauer of Schriftlabor and Georg Seifert. Special thanks go to Dave Crossland and Google Fonts for making the libre release of this font family possible through generous funding of the development process.\n\nThe Cormorant project is led by Christian Thalmann, a type designer based in Zurich, Switzerland.

Soramitsu, the developer of Sora, is a Japanese technology company specializing in blockchain development and well-known for creating the first central bank digital currency.\n\nSora typeface was designed to capture Soramitsu's spirit and heritage resulting in a type family with cues of low-resolution aesthetics and early screen typography but without nostalgia, as every decision was considered towards the crisp digital environment of today. The particularly big x-height combined with evidently generous counters turns the family into a convenient tool for app and web interfaces, where clarity and effectiveness at any size is an imperative.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/sora-xor/sora-font"

It has a low contrast and tall x-height to improve readability of texts in small sizes as well as in large distances from the reader. Being a typical signage typeface it is inspired by typefaces such as Ronnia, Meta, and Tahoma.\n\nThe typeface comes with a wide character set supporting Western European languages, Polish, and Czech. The figures are designed as tabular.\n\nSignika Negative is an alternative version, optimized to solve the effect of juxtaposed positive and negative text setting, where the text in negative tends to look thicker.\n\nThe source code of Signika is available from Github."

    "description": "IBM Plex™ is an international typeface family designed by Mike Abbink, IBM BX&D, in collaboration with Bold Monday, an independent Dutch type foundry. Plex was designed to capture IBM’s spirit and history, and to illustrate the unique relationship between mankind and machine—a principal theme for IBM since the turn of the century. The result is a neutral, yet friendly Grotesque style typeface that includes a Sans, Sans Condensed, Mono, Serif, and several other styles for several languages, and has excellent legibility in print, web and mobile interfaces. Plex’s three designs work well independently, and even better together. Use the Sans as a contemporary compadre, the Serif for editorial storytelling, or the Mono to show code snippets. The unexpectedly expressive nature of the italics give you even more options for your designs."

Derived from Western Greek, attested in Rome in the 7th century BCE. In the common era, numerous European languages adopted the Latin script along with Western Christian religion, the script disseminated further with European colonization of the Americas, Australia, parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific. New letters, ligatures and diacritical marks were gradually added to represent the sounds of various languages.

Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nEmoji symbols\nlink\n\nEmoji symbols are pictograms, logograms, ideograms and smileys used in electronic messages and web pages. Their primary function is to fill in emotional cues otherwise missing from typed conversation. They are typically rendered as multi-color characters.

Developed in 1913 in China to be used for Mandarin Chinese transliteration alongside the Latin-based Wade–Giles system. Also called Mandarin Phonetic Symbols or Zhuyin (注音). Bopomofo is an official transliteration system in Taiwan, used in dictionaries, books, newspapers and journals to annotate the Taiwanese pronunciation of Chinese Han characters, and in electronic input methods. Largely replaced by Pinyin romanization in the People’s Republic of China. Also used as the primary script for Taiwan’s minority languages like Atayal, Taroko, Paiwan and Yami. Has 21 onset consonants, 16 rhymes, and 4 tone marks. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nCyrillic\nlink\n\nCyrillic is a bicameral alphabet originating in Europe, written left-to-right (250 million users). Used for various languages across Eurasia and is used as the national script in various Slavic, Turkic, Mongolic and Iranic-speaking countries in Southeastern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, North Asia and East Asia, including Russian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Azerbaijani, Kazakh, Tajik, Kyrgyz, Bashkort, Chechen, Chuvash, Avar, Dargwa, Kabardian, Karakalpak, Kumyk, Lezgi, Ossetic, Pontic, Yakut, Buriat and many others. Created in the 9th century. Traditionally attributed to Saint Cyril, a monk from Thessaloniki working in Bulgaria, after earlier creation of the Glagolitic script. Sometimes attributed to Clement of Ohrid, a student of Saint Cyril’s. Initially used for Old Church Slavonic. Reformed in 1708 by Russian tsar Peter the Great. Extended by the Soviet Union in the 20th century to write over 50 languages throughout Eastern Europe and Asia (some of those languages switched to Latin after 1991). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nGreek\nlink\n\nGreek (Ελληνικά) is a European bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right (11 million users). Used to write the Greek language since the 8th century BCE. Also used to write other languages like Urum, Albanian Tosk, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish. Some symbols are also used in scientific notation. Derived from Phoenician. First “true alphabet”, with distinct letters for consonants and vowels. Standardized in the 4th century BCE by Eucleides. Has 24 letters. Some letter variants (sigma: σ/ς) have positional significance in the Greek language, other variants only differ in meaning in scientific notation (e.g. pi: π/ϖ). The Greek language used to be written in polytonic spelling, with three accents on vowels. In 1982, Greece introduced monotonic spelling with a single diacritic. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a."

    "description": "From the very first steps in the design process, Domine was designed, tested and optimized for body text on the web. Harmless to the eyes when reading long texts, Domine is a perfect choice for newspapers or magazines websites, where text is the main focus. It shines at px sizes 14 and 16, and can even be used as small as 11 px.\n\nFriendly in appearance, it combines the classic elements of familiar typefaces that have been in use from more than 100 years like Clarendon, Century, Cheltenham and Clearface.\n\nThe rounded letters (b, c, d, e, o, p, q) are a bit squarish on the inside. This feature opens up the counters for better rendering and also make it look a bit more up-to-date than the classic typefaces previously referenced.\nThe serifs are a bit shorter than usual. Another feature that improves the rendering by allowing more \"air\" between each letter pair.\nThe joins of the stems to the branches in letters like h, m, n are deep enough to prevent dark spots, also improving legibility at small sizes.\nThe friendly lowercase 'a', with the curve starting from the bottom of the stem, is reminiscent of Cheltenham and Clearface. That soft curve is also echoed in the curves of the f, j, n, m and r.\nThe spacing is also optimized for body text on the web, clearly more open than that of typefaces made for print or for headlines.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/Dominee."

    "description": "Merriweather Sans is a low-contrast semi-condensed sans-serif text typeface family designed to be pleasant to read at very small sizes. Merriweather Sans is traditional in feeling despite the modern shapes it has adopted for screens.\n\nMerriweather Sans is an evolving project and will be updated. As of now there are 8 styles: Light, Regular, Bold, and ExtraBold weights in Roman and Italic styles.\n\nThere is also Merriweather, a serif version which closely harmonizes with the weights and styles of this sans-serif family.\n\nDesigned by Eben Sorkin, Merriweather Sans features a large x height, slightly condensed letterforms, a mild diagonal stress and open forms.\n\nMerriweather Sans is a work in progress and will be improved regularly. This means you can request improvements and even fund specific features if if they are outside of the current scope of work. For more information and to stay updated see Eben Sorkin's blog and Flickr stream, and the MerriweatherFnt Twitter microblog.\n\nUpdated in June 2013 with italic styles.\n\nUpdated in January 2016: This revision improves on-screen rendering especially at text sizes with ttfautohint hinting. Merriweather Sans will work better when installed on desktops. Some OpenType features were added and improved. Since the vertical and horizontal metrics changed, this may cause some text to reflow in some browsers. A second update (v1.006) was made on 1/25 to fix ligatures and other digraphs.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/SorkinType/Merriweather-Sans."

    "description": "Source Serif 4 is a serif typeface in the transitional style, designed to complement the Source Sans Pro family. The close companionship of Serif and Sans is achieved by a careful match of letter proportions and typographic color. Source Serif is loosely based on the work of Pierre Simon Fournier, and many idiosyncrasies typical to Fournier’s designs (like the bottom serif on the b or the middle serif on the w) are also found in Source Serif. Without being a pure historical revival, Source Serif takes cues from Fournier and reworks them for a modern age.\n\nBoth typeface families have different personalities because they spring from the hands of different designers: Source Serif was designed by Frank Grießhammer, Source Sans was designed by Paul Hunt. Robert Slimbach consulted on both designs, which helped maintain the overall family harmony. Either design feels confident on its own but also works in combination with the other — just like their designers do.\n\nSource Serif continues Adobe’s line of high-quality open source typefaces. Designed for a digital environment, the letter shapes are simplified and highly readable. Its historical roots, combined with expert guidance give the typeface a strong character of its own that will shine when used for extended text on paper or screen.\n\nSource Serif is an active Open Source project – if you are interested in contributing, please visit source-serif-pro on Github for more information."

In post-colonial times, African countries aiming to maintain their native (non-colonial) languages face a major roadblock: not enough fonts with Pan-African support that provide all of the letters and diacritics (or accent) marks for the proper spelling of their languages.\n\nProper spelling isn’t just for school tests and national spelling competitions, it’s vital for communication and for language survival. Educational institutions and users need fonts that can show the orthography (proper spelling) for each language, so that students can learn how to write correctly. Otherwise, if pupils see the same word written in different ways, with different kinds of punctuation marks replacing diacritics, they may never learn the proper way to spell. Without standard spelling, students could confuse words that may look similar but have different meanings.\n\nThese are some examples of words in African languages with similar spellings and different meanings:\n\nfɔ (to say) and fo (to greet) in Bambara\nmotó (head) and mɔ́tɔ (fire) in Lingala\nọ̀tá (enemy) and ota (bullet) in Yoruba\n\nTo learn more, read:\nGiving African languages more Latin font choices (English)\nOffrir plus de choix de polices latines pour les langues africaines (French)"

    "description": "Frank Ruhl Libre is an open source version of the classic Hebrew typeface Frank Rühl, the most ubiquitous Hebrew typeface in print. Frank Rühl was designed in 1908 by Rafael Frank in collaboration with Auto Rühl of the C. F. Rühl foundry of Leipzig. A final version was released in 1910. Many Israeli books, newspapers and magazines use Frank Rühl as their main body text typeface.\n\nMade to accommodate the growing need for typefaces in secular Hebrew writings, the typeface was fitted to modern printing demands and designed to be readable in longform text, with and without vowel marks. Frank Rühl has Sephardi proportions (mem-height is approximately 4½ stroke widths), and is based roughly on Venetian typefaces used by printer Daniel Bomberg. Frank wrote of his design that he wishes to combine the simpleness of Antiqua with the \"pleasantness\" of Fraktur, leading him to \"quieten\" the letterforms by reducing the contrast between its thin and thick strokes.\n\nThis newly designed revival by Yanek Iontef is a family of 7 weights, Light to Black (the original typeface had only one) and in November 2022, it became variable and offers a larger choice of weights.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/fontef/frankruhllibre."

An adult re-reads a news article and still doesn’t understand what it’s about. Both readers end up frustrated and feeling like there is something wrong with them. Thankfully there might be a simple answer. Dr. Bonnie Shaver-Troup thinks fonts are part of the problem and the solution to many reading problems.\n\n“We have a global reading crisis and we can change much of it by delivering fonts that are optimized for the visual field and for the individual. The answer is hidden in plain sight. It’s the font,” said Shaver-Troup.\n\nChange the font, change the outcome\nlink\n\nWhile working as an educational therapist in Silicon Valley, Shaver-Troup helped students with dyslexia and other reading problems to learn to read. She experimented by changing the spacing between certain letters in their reading assignments, and found that it improved their reading and comprehension. According to Shaver-Troup, the issue wasn’t in her students’ minds, it was with the letterforms they saw on the screen or paper.\n\n“The majority of the reading problems, including dyslexia, are not cognitive or phonological. They are visual or perceptual. Our testing has a built-in design flaw. We use fonts to deliver text for reading that are too tight for efficient or successful visual processing. Then we get poor results, suggesting the reading issue is phonological or cognitive. If we change the font to the tested optimized font fit, then we change the outcome,” she explained.\n\nTo learn more, read:\nClean and clear: making reading easier with Lexend (English)\nPartnering to change how the world reads (English)\nEine Partnerschaft mit dem Ziel, das Leseerlebnis weltweit zu verändern: Erweiterung von Lexend um verschiedene Schriftstärken (German)"

    "description": "Cormorant is a free display type family developed by Christian Thalmann. The project currently comprises a total of 45 font files spanning 9 different visual styles (Roman, Italic, Infant, Infant Italic, Garamond, Garamond Italic, Upright Cursive, Small Caps, and Unicase) and 5 weights (Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold.) Cormorant was conceived, drawn, spaced, kerned, programmed, interpolated, and produced in its entirety by Christian Thalmann of Catharsis Fonts. For an illustrated presentation and description of the family, please visit its Bēhance page.\n\nWhile this project was heavily inspired by Claude Garamont's immortal legacy, Christian did not use any specific font as a starting point or direct reference for the designs. Most glyphs were drawn from scratch; when he needed guidance on a specific character, he searched for the term Garamond and skimmed through the results for a general impression.\n\nHe is grateful to the creative souls on the Typophile, TypeDrawers and Typografie forums, and Github, for a wealth of knowledge about type design, and for providing a large amount of excellent feedback on Cormorant during its development. He also thanks the tireless folks at Glyphs, in particular Rainer Erich Scheichelbauer of Schriftlabor and Georg Seifert. Special thanks go to Dave Crossland and Google Fonts for making the libre release of this font family possible through generous funding of the development process.\n\nThe Cormorant project is led by Christian Thalmann, a type designer based in Zurich, Switzerland.

If you’ve ever seen a futuristic sci-fi movie, you may have noticed that all other fonts have been lost or destroyed in the apocalypse that led humans to flee earth. Only those very few geometric typefaces have survived to be used on spaceship exteriors, spacestation signage, monopolistic corporate branding, uniforms featuring aerodynamic shoulder pads, etc. Of course Orbitron could also be used on the posters for the movies portraying this inevitable future.

At that point Google Fonts had fewer than 10 Japanese families, most of which were basic Mincho (serif) and gothic (sans) designs. Since then the collection of Japanese fonts within the library has grown, now with 38 font families from 18 designers, in a variety of styles – from formal text types to fun display fonts. All these Japanese fonts are now live on Google Fonts for anyone to test out and use in any project.\n\nThe Zen Fonts collection is the largest set of Japanese fonts on Google Fonts\nlink\n\nAs part of this larger effort to expand Japanese offerings, Google Fonts collaborated with type designer Yoshimichi Ohira to open his prestigious collection of Zen Fonts typefaces to the public. With 23 Japanese and three Latin fonts in various styles of mincho (serif), gothic (sans serif), maru (rounded), and display styles, the Zen Fonts collection is now the largest set of Japanese fonts in Google Fonts’ expansive library, and is also available in Adobe Fonts.

    "description": "Kalam is a handwriting-style typeface supporting the Devanagari and Latin scripts. This is an Open Source font family first published by the Indian Type Foundry in 2014.\n\nEven though Kalam's letterforms derive from handwriting, the fonts have each been optimised for text on screen. All in all, the typeface is a design that feels very personal. Like many informal handwriting-style fonts, it appears rather fresh and new when seen on screen or printed on the page. Kalam's letterforms feature a very steep slant from the top right to the bottom left. They are similar to letters used in everyday handwriting, and look like they might have been written with either a thin felt-tip pen, or a ball-point pen. In the Devanagari letterforms, the knotted-terminals are open, but some other counter forms are closed. Features like these strengthen the feeling that text set in this typeface has been written very quickly, in a rapid manner.\n\nKalam is available in three weights: Light, Regular and Bold. Each font contains 1,025 glyphs, which includes many unique Devanagari conjuncts. These ensure full support for the major languages written with the Devanagari script. The Latin component's character set is a basic western one, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western European languages. Lipi Raval and Jonny Pinhorn developed the family for ITF; Raval designed the Devanagari component while she and Pinhorn worked together on the Latin.\n\nThe Kalam project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India. To contribute, see github.com/itfoundry/kalam\n\nUpdated July 2015: Updated to v2.001 with improved OpenType features."

    "description": "Alegreya was chosen as one of 53 \"Fonts of the Decade\" at the ATypI Letter2 competition in September 2011, and one of the top 14 text type systems. It was also selected in the 2nd Bienal Iberoamericana de Diseño, competition held in Madrid in 2010.\n\nAlegreya is a typeface originally intended for literature. Among its crowning characteristics, it conveys a dynamic and varied rhythm which facilitates the reading of long texts. Also, it provides freshness to the page while referring to the calligraphic letter, not as a literal interpretation, but rather in a contemporary typographic language.\n\nThe italic has just as much care and attention to detail in the design as the roman. The bold weights are strong, and the Black weights are really experimental for the genre. There is also a Small Caps sibling family.\n\nNot only does Alegreya provide great performance, but also achieves a strong and harmonious text by means of elements designed in an atmosphere of diversity.\n\nThe Alegreya type system is a \"super family\", originally intended for literature, and includes serif and sans serif sister families.\n\nDesigned by Juan Pablo del Peral for Huerta Tipográfica.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/huertatipografica/Alegreya."

Used for over 3,000 languages including Latin and Romance languages (Italian, French, Portuguese, Spanish and Romanian), Germanic languages (English, Dutch, German, Nordic languages), Finnish, Malaysian, Indonesian, Filipino, Visayan languages, Turkish, Azerbaijani, Polish, Somali, Vietnamese, and many others. Derived from Western Greek, attested in Rome in the 7th century BCE. In the common era, numerous European languages adopted the Latin script along with Western Christian religion, the script disseminated further with European colonization of the Americas, Australia, parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific. New letters, ligatures and diacritical marks were gradually added to represent the sounds of various languages. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nCyrillic\nlink\n\nCyrillic is a bicameral alphabet originating in Europe, written left-to-right (250 million users). Used for various languages across Eurasia and is used as the national script in various Slavic, Turkic, Mongolic and Iranic-speaking countries in Southeastern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, North Asia and East Asia, including Russian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Azerbaijani, Kazakh, Tajik, Kyrgyz, Bashkort, Chechen, Chuvash, Avar, Dargwa, Kabardian, Karakalpak, Kumyk, Lezgi, Ossetic, Pontic, Yakut, Buriat and many others. Created in the 9th century. Traditionally attributed to Saint Cyril, a monk from Thessaloniki working in Bulgaria, after earlier creation of the Glagolitic script. Sometimes attributed to Clement of Ohrid, a student of Saint Cyril’s. Initially used for Old Church Slavonic. Reformed in 1708 by Russian tsar Peter the Great. Extended by the Soviet Union in the 20th century to write over 50 languages throughout Eastern Europe and Asia (some of those languages switched to Latin after 1991). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nGreek\nlink\n\nGreek (Ελληνικά) is a European bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right (11 million users). Used to write the Greek language since the 8th century BCE. Also used to write other languages like Urum, Albanian Tosk, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish. Some symbols are also used in scientific notation. Derived from Phoenician. First “true alphabet”, with distinct letters for consonants and vowels. Standardized in the 4th century BCE by Eucleides. Has 24 letters. Some letter variants (sigma: σ/ς) have positional significance in the Greek language, other variants only differ in meaning in scientific notation (e.g. pi: π/ϖ). The Greek language used to be written in polytonic spelling, with three accents on vowels. In 1982, Greece introduced monotonic spelling with a single diacritic. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a."

Based on traditional Chinese Han characters, Hanja was used for the Korean language until 1446, when King Sejong introduced Hangul. Until the mid-20th century Hanja and Hangul were used in parallel or mixed. Today, the vast majority of Korean text uses Hangul but Hanja is still used in some context, and schools teach some 1,000-3,000 Hanja symbols. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nHangul\nlink\n\nHangul (Hangeul, 한글, Chosŏn'gŭl, 조선글) is an East Asian script, written vertically right-to-left and horizontally left-to-right (79 million users). Used for the Korean language. Created in 1446 by King Sejong the Great (Sejong of Joseon) as a simpler, phonetic alternative to using Chinese hanja for Korean. Not universally accepted for centuries, suppressed by Japanese colonial authorities. Since 1945 the standard script for Korean. The 51 basic letters (jamo) are grouped into syllable blocks depending on their position in the spoken syllable. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nLatin\nlink\n\nLatin (Roman) is a European bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right. The most popular writing system in the world. Used for over 3,000 languages including Latin and Romance languages (Italian, French, Portuguese, Spanish and Romanian), Germanic languages (English, Dutch, German, Nordic languages), Finnish, Malaysian, Indonesian, Filipino, Visayan languages, Turkish, Azerbaijani, Polish, Somali, Vietnamese, and many others. Derived from Western Greek, attested in Rome in the 7th century BCE. In the common era, numerous European languages adopted the Latin script along with Western Christian religion, the script disseminated further with European colonization of the Americas, Australia, parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific. New letters, ligatures and diacritical marks were gradually added to represent the sounds of various languages. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nKatakana\nlink\n\nKatakana (片仮名、カタカナ) is an East Asian syllabary, written vertically right-to-left and horizontally left-to-right (126 million users). Used in Japan for Japanese, Ryukyuan, Ainu and Palauan, and formerly for Taiwanese Hokkien. Katakana is used for transcription of foreign-language words into Japanese, for the writing of loan words, for emphasis, to represent onomatopoeia, for technical and scientific terms, for names of plants, animals and minerals, and often for names of Japanese companies.

Used in Japan for Japanese and the Ryukyuan languages. Hiragana is used to write okurigana (kana suffixes following a kanji root, for example to inflect verbs and adjectives), various grammatical and function words including particles, as well as miscellaneous other native words for which there are no kanji or whose kanji form is obscure or too formal for the writing purpose. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nEmoji symbols\nlink\n\nEmoji symbols are pictograms, logograms, ideograms and smileys used in electronic messages and web pages. Their primary function is to fill in emotional cues otherwise missing from typed conversation. They are typically rendered as multi-color characters. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, r12a.\n\nBopomofo\nlink\n\nBopomofo (注音符號, 注音符号, ㄅㄆㄇㄈ) is an East Asian syllabary, written left-to-right. Developed in 1913 in China to be used for Mandarin Chinese transliteration alongside the Latin-based Wade–Giles system. Also called Mandarin Phonetic Symbols or Zhuyin (注音). Bopomofo is an official transliteration system in Taiwan, used in dictionaries, books, newspapers and journals to annotate the Taiwanese pronunciation of Chinese Han characters, and in electronic input methods. Largely replaced by Pinyin romanization in the People’s Republic of China. Also used as the primary script for Taiwan’s minority languages like Atayal, Taroko, Paiwan and Yami. Has 21 onset consonants, 16 rhymes, and 4 tone marks. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nCyrillic\nlink\n\nCyrillic is a bicameral alphabet originating in Europe, written left-to-right (250 million users). Used for various languages across Eurasia and is used as the national script in various Slavic, Turkic, Mongolic and Iranic-speaking countries in Southeastern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, North Asia and East Asia, including Russian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Azerbaijani, Kazakh, Tajik, Kyrgyz, Bashkort, Chechen, Chuvash, Avar, Dargwa, Kabardian, Karakalpak, Kumyk, Lezgi, Ossetic, Pontic, Yakut, Buriat and many others. Created in the 9th century. Traditionally attributed to Saint Cyril, a monk from Thessaloniki working in Bulgaria, after earlier creation of the Glagolitic script. Sometimes attributed to Clement of Ohrid, a student of Saint Cyril’s. Initially used for Old Church Slavonic. Reformed in 1708 by Russian tsar Peter the Great. Extended by the Soviet Union in the 20th century to write over 50 languages throughout Eastern Europe and Asia (some of those languages switched to Latin after 1991). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nGreek\nlink\n\nGreek (Ελληνικά) is a European bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right (11 million users). Used to write the Greek language since the 8th century BCE. Also used to write other languages like Urum, Albanian Tosk, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish. Some symbols are also used in scientific notation. Derived from Phoenician. First “true alphabet”, with distinct letters for consonants and vowels. Standardized in the 4th century BCE by Eucleides. Has 24 letters. Some letter variants (sigma: σ/ς) have positional significance in the Greek language, other variants only differ in meaning in scientific notation (e.g. pi: π/ϖ). The Greek language used to be written in polytonic spelling, with three accents on vowels. In 1982, Greece introduced monotonic spelling with a single diacritic. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a."

    "description": "Hind Madurai is a family of five Tamil fonts, which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. In addition to Tamil, the Hind Madurai fonts also include Latin-script characters.\n\nDeveloped explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. Most of these strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. Additionally, Hind’s letterforms feature open apertures and counterforms. The entire family feels very legible when used to set text.\n\nThe Tamil and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that the head of the Tamil characters falls just below the Latin capital-height. Depending in the font weight, Tamil letters appear to be about 80–85% of the height of the Latin uppercase. Text set in the Tamil script sits nicely alongside the Latin’s lowercase, too. Although Hind Madurai is a “monolinear sans” face, much of its design features tends toward the traditional end of the design spectrum. Each font in the Hind Madurai family has 552 glyphs, which includes all of the characters needed to write Tamil. The Latin character set is Adobe Latin 3, enabling typesetting for English and other Western European languages.\n\nHind Madurai is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding. Jyotish Sonowal designed Hind Madurai for ITF, who first published the fonts in 2015. Hind Madurai is named after Madurai, a city in Tamil Nadu, India.\n\nThe Hind Madurai project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India.

Its Bold is reminiscent of 1920s coffee house typography, while the rather thin fonts bridge the gap to present times. Lacking self confidence and knowledge about the type scene, Yanone decided to publish the family for free under a Creative Commons License. A decision that should turn out one of the best he ever made. It has been downloaded over 100,000 times to date, and you can witness Kaffeesatz use on German fresh-water gyms, Dubai mall promos and New Zealand McDonalds ads. And of course on coffee and foodstuff packaging and café design around the globe.\n\nIn 2009 he reworked much of the typeface and it got published in FontShop’s FontFont Library under the new name FF Kava.

    "description": "The old posters and signs in the traditional Montserrat neighborhood of Buenos Aires inspired Julieta to design this typeface and rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century. As urban development changes that place, it will never return to its original form and loses forever the designs that are so special and unique. The letters that inspired this project have work, dedication, care, color, contrast, light and life, day and night! These are the types that make the city look so beautiful. The Montserrat Project began with the idea to rescue what is in Montserrat and set it free under a libre license, the SIL Open Font License.\n\nThis is the Alternates family, a sister to the normal and Subrayada families. Many of the letterforms are special in the Alternates family, while 'Subrayada' means 'Underlined' in Spanish and celebrates a special style of underline that is integrated into the letterforms found in the Montserrat neighborhood.\n\nUpdated November 2017: The family was redrawn by Jacques Le Bailly at Baron von Fonthausen over the summer, and the full set of weights were adjusted to make the Regular lighter and better for use in longer texts. In fall, Julieta Ulanovsky, Sol Matas, and Juan Pablo del Peral, led the development of Cyrillic support, with consultation with Carolina Giovagnoli, Maria Doreuli, and Alexei Vanyashin.\n\nThe Montserrat project is led by Julieta Ulanovsky, a type designer based in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

The Antic Type System is a super family that is still evolving, and this first release of the Slab family. It complements the Sans and Didone versions, giving the designer freedom to create rhythmic and dynamic typography using all three families in the type system.\n\nEach family in the type system has a large x-height that makes it very readable, especially on the web. Each also has slight stress derived from handwriting. Antic Slab's discreet slab serifs give it a strong presence in layouts. With modern proportions and condensed letterforms, it is great for economical typesetting, on paper and on screen.\n\nThe Antic Type System is in progress and is being regularly improved. If you have a request, wish to contribute improvements or even fund specific features, simply contact Santiago Orozco. You can follow Santiago on Twitter, @Typemade."

Used for the Korean language. Created in 1446 by King Sejong the Great (Sejong of Joseon) as a simpler, phonetic alternative to using Chinese hanja for Korean. Not universally accepted for centuries, suppressed by Japanese colonial authorities. Since 1945 the standard script for Korean. The 51 basic letters (jamo) are grouped into syllable blocks depending on their position in the spoken syllable.

Used for over 3,000 languages including Latin and Romance languages (Italian, French, Portuguese, Spanish and Romanian), Germanic languages (English, Dutch, German, Nordic languages), Finnish, Malaysian, Indonesian, Filipino, Visayan languages, Turkish, Azerbaijani, Polish, Somali, Vietnamese, and many others. Derived from Western Greek, attested in Rome in the 7th century BCE. In the common era, numerous European languages adopted the Latin script along with Western Christian religion, the script disseminated further with European colonization of the Americas, Australia, parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific. New letters, ligatures and diacritical marks were gradually added to represent the sounds of various languages.

Their primary function is to fill in emotional cues otherwise missing from typed conversation. They are typically rendered as multi-color characters. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, r12a.\n\nBopomofo\nlink\n\nBopomofo (注音符號, 注音符号, ㄅㄆㄇㄈ) is an East Asian syllabary, written left-to-right. Developed in 1913 in China to be used for Mandarin Chinese transliteration alongside the Latin-based Wade–Giles system. Also called Mandarin Phonetic Symbols or Zhuyin (注音). Bopomofo is an official transliteration system in Taiwan, used in dictionaries, books, newspapers and journals to annotate the Taiwanese pronunciation of Chinese Han characters, and in electronic input methods. Largely replaced by Pinyin romanization in the People’s Republic of China. Also used as the primary script for Taiwan’s minority languages like Atayal, Taroko, Paiwan and Yami. Has 21 onset consonants, 16 rhymes, and 4 tone marks. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nCyrillic\nlink\n\nCyrillic is a bicameral alphabet originating in Europe, written left-to-right (250 million users). Used for various languages across Eurasia and is used as the national script in various Slavic, Turkic, Mongolic and Iranic-speaking countries in Southeastern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, North Asia and East Asia, including Russian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Azerbaijani, Kazakh, Tajik, Kyrgyz, Bashkort, Chechen, Chuvash, Avar, Dargwa, Kabardian, Karakalpak, Kumyk, Lezgi, Ossetic, Pontic, Yakut, Buriat and many others. Created in the 9th century. Traditionally attributed to Saint Cyril, a monk from Thessaloniki working in Bulgaria, after earlier creation of the Glagolitic script. Sometimes attributed to Clement of Ohrid, a student of Saint Cyril’s. Initially used for Old Church Slavonic. Reformed in 1708 by Russian tsar Peter the Great. Extended by the Soviet Union in the 20th century to write over 50 languages throughout Eastern Europe and Asia (some of those languages switched to Latin after 1991). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nGreek\nlink\n\nGreek (Ελληνικά) is a European bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right (11 million users). Used to write the Greek language since the 8th century BCE. Also used to write other languages like Urum, Albanian Tosk, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish. Some symbols are also used in scientific notation. Derived from Phoenician. First “true alphabet”, with distinct letters for consonants and vowels. Standardized in the 4th century BCE by Eucleides. Has 24 letters. Some letter variants (sigma: σ/ς) have positional significance in the Greek language, other variants only differ in meaning in scientific notation (e.g. pi: π/ϖ). The Greek language used to be written in polytonic spelling, with three accents on vowels. In 1982, Greece introduced monotonic spelling with a single diacritic. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a."

It supports a Latin Extended glyph set, enabling typesetting for English and other Western European languages.\n\nDeveloped for editorial use in headline and display typography, the letterforms infuse a geometric foundation and grotesque details with qualities often found in headline typefaces of the 1960s (See: Microgramma, Eurostile), many of which have since been co-opted by science fiction films, television, and literature.\n\nTypographic features include old-style figures, superscript and subscript numerals, fractions, center-height and cap-height currency symbols, directional arrows, and multiple stylistic alternates.\n\nColophon Foundry is a London and Los Angeles-based digital type foundry established in 2009. Its members comprise Benjamin Critton (US), Edd Harrington (UK), and Anthony Sheret (UK). The foundry's commissioned work in type design is complemented by work in editorial design, publishing, curation, and pedagogy.

It’s about adapting the proportional type’s forms and rules, and discovering how those letterforms behave within fixed limits to give the face new texture and capability. But what if that constraint was embraced? What if we set out to create a monospaced typeface that wasn’t simply an extension, but rather something unto itself?\n\nTo learn more, read Introducing Space Mono a new monospaced typeface by Colophon Foundry for Google Fonts."

It has a large x-height, ample proportions, big serifs and large apertures that allow the letters to be clear, even at small sizes on low resolution screens. The capitals are unusually small, allowing them to be used as substitutes for small caps. (It's recommended to add some tracking if used in this way.)\n\nOne major feature is the break in the internal curves of round characters. While this break makes some interesting forms at large sizes, their true purpose is to help make the counterforms more open at small sizes by allowing straighter stems. This reasoning is famously known as W.A. Dwiggins' “M-formula.”\n\nThe italics were designed to contrast with the roman styles while maintaining good legibility. The true italic forms also have big counterforms and simple curves.\n\nThe fonts have been manually hinted to get the best possible rasterization in Windows.\n\nThe Noticia font family project is envisioned as 18 different fonts styles, with text, condensed, display and sans variants, different weights and including italic versions, all designed and hinted to work well on computer and mobile devices screens."

    "description": "Roboto Serif is a variable typeface family designed to create a comfortable and frictionless reading experience. Minimal and highly functional, it is useful anywhere (even for app interfaces) due to the extensive set of weights and widths across a broad range of optical sizes. While it was carefully crafted to work well in digital media, across the full scope of sizes and resolutions we have today, it is just as comfortable to read and work in print media.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/roboto-serif.\n\nSay hello to Roboto Serif\nlink\nThe newest member of the Roboto superfamily is designed to make reading more comfortable at any size, in any format.\nlink\n\nGet it on Google Fonts and check out the specimen: Getting Comfortable With Roboto Serif.\n\nIt's been almost 20 years since the introduction of Matthew Carter’s Georgia—one of the first serif typefaces designed to make reading easier on the low-resolution screens of the time. That year (1993), Americans with Internet access spent fewer than 30 minutes a month surfing the Web. Now we spend almost seven hours a day.\n\nThankfully, reading on-screen has gotten a lot more comfortable since the 90’s. For one thing, you can pick up your device and move over to the sofa. Letterforms are also crisper, smoother, and more legible on today’s screens/devices—and they render more quickly. But another huge (though perhaps less obvious) factor in all of this is the advancement of font technology. Georgia was one of the first eleven “Core Fonts for the Web” that paved the way for OpenType and, eventually, variable fonts. Today, a well-designed, OpenType serif can be just as readable on-screen as it is in print. And a well-designed variable serif can give readers additional benefits on-screen. Enter: Roboto Serif.\n\nTo learn more, read Say Hello to Roboto Serif."

They created Readex Pro in Arabic using the methodology behind Lexend, made for Latin. The name Readex was chosen as a shortened form of “reading expanded.”\n\nWhen Dr. Bonnie Shaver-Troup started the Lexend project, her goal was to help people to read more easily and fluently by reducing visual noise. The Lexend fonts have distinct letterforms, and offer the option to widen tracking (the spacing between letters) together with widening the shapes of individual letterforms themselves. This novel functionality is based on a theory known as the “Shaver-Troup Formulation,” which was described in detail in a 2003 USA patent application.\n\nTo learn more, read The Design of Readex Pro (English) and خط ‏Readex Pro: استكشاف حدود سهولة قراءة النص من خلال خط عربي جديد (Arabic)"

    "description": "News Cycle is a realist, sans-serif typeface based primarily on a revival of the 1908-era News Gothic, the stalwart newspaper face from American Type Founders (ATF). Like News Gothic, it is designed for clarity and readability in large blocks of copy, but to still look good in headline-sizes at the top of the page. It also extends News Gothic to better cover more of the world's orthographies, starting with Eastern European and African languages, and soon Greek and Cyrillic alphabets as well.\n\nThis project is led by Nathan Wilis, a type designer based in Texas, USA.

However, this lettertype still has at least two advantages:\n\nit can be considered a good choice for typesetting scientific papers, especially on social and humanitarian sciences, as its specific features are closely associated in people's eyes with old books they learned on;\nthe most beautiful examples of Greek and Cyrillic lettertypes were all based on the classicist style, so for those scripts, \"Modern\" fonts are much more appropriate than any contemporary (e. g. Times-based) designs.\n\nThe name \"Old Standard\" was selected as opposed to the \"Obyknovennaya Novaya\" (\"New Standard\") typeface, widely used in Soviet typography, which represents another, slightly different type of the same Modern style. Of course this name doesn't look very original, but it seems to be a good choice for a revival of the most common lettertype of the early 20th century."

    "description": "When making digital typefaces, the more you refine the shapes of the letters, the more energy you take away from them. Because of that, Kaushan Script is unrefined - and carries a lot of energy.\n\nBy avoiding typographical perfection, it stays more natural. The angles of the vertical strokes vary a little, and the positioning along the baseline jumps around, giving it a more rustic and natural feeling.\n\nMost script fonts have long ascenders and descenders, and this means they look too small when used at normal sizes on the web. This font is optimized in such details to be very readable as a web font, even when used as small as 16 px.\n\nIt was funded by people like you, via Kickstarter. Special thanks to the project backers! The name \"Kaushan\" was suggested by Vyacheslav Kaushan, one of the project backers."

    "description": "A perfect blend of pointy paws in a coat of fur, Baloo is an affable display typeface by Ek Type. Available in nine Indian scripts plus Arabic along with a Latin counterpart, the family is Unicode compliant and libre licensed.\n\nBaloo 2 is an extension of the earlier Baloo project. The new Baloo 2 includes additional glyphs, engineering improvements, and has been extended to five weights, ranging from the light footed Regular to the affable ExtraBold. The lighter weights retain Baloo’s characteristic bounce, but they do so slightly, infusing life into each word. This allows the new family to freely fraternise with texts of all sizes and temperaments — be it short bursts or copious reams, demanding headlines or whispering bylines. Carefree yet confident, sprightly yet versatile, the renewed family of Baloo promises to bring warmth to every project.\n\nThe Baloo 2 project consists of ten font families with unique local names for each of the nine Indic scripts plus Arabic (Baloo Bhaijaan 2). Each family supports one Indic/Arabic script plus Latin, Latin Extended, and Vietnamese.\n\nIt took a team of committed type designers to rear Baloo and raise it to be the typeface we love. The Gurmukhi is designed by Shuchita Grover; Bangla by Noopur Datye and Sulekha Rajkumar; Odia by Yesha Goshar, Manish Minz, and Shuchita Grover; Gujarati by Noopur Datye and Supriya Tembe; Kannada by Divya Kowshik and Shuchita Grover; Telugu by Maithili Shingre and Omkar Shende; Malayalam by Maithili Shingre and Unnati Kotecha; and Tamil by Aadarsh Rajan. Baloo Devanagari and Latin are collaboratively designed by Ek Type. Font engineering and type design assistance by Girish Dalvi.\n\nTo contribute to the project, visit github.com/EkType/Baloo2"

    "description": "Bricolage Grotesque is a collage of lots of different things: historical sources, technical decisions and personal feelings. It started as a fork of Mayenne Sans, an open-source single weight font designed by Jérémy Landes (Studio Triple). It evolved by reinforcing cues from French sources and British sources: the compressed weights lean more towards the anxious and wonky tones of Grotesque Nº9 and the regular weights have a bit more of Antique Olive's relaxed and confident attitude. The smaller optical sizes become more neutral and reflective of contemporary sans serifs, notably through the use of exaggerated ink traps.\n\nBy blending iconic British and French designs with modern trends and tools, it aims to traverse a complex typographical and emotional landscape. At the same time, it’s so steeped in historical sources and references that it’s hard to call it anything but a re-interpretation of the same ideas but for a different purpose: trying to express visually what it feels like to move countries and rebuild, what it feels like to have a hybrid identity where you cannot be what you were and yet you can never truly be anybody else.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/ateliertriay/bricolage."

    "description": "Atkinson Hyperlegible, named after the founder of the Braille Institute, has been developed specifically to increase legibility for readers with low vision, and to improve comprehension.\n\nHaving a traditional grotesque sans-serif at its core, it departs from tradition to incorporate unambiguous, distinctive elements—and at times, unexpected forms—always with the goal of increasing character recognition and ultimately improve reading.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/atkinson-hyperlegible.\n\nFrom Rebranding to Readability with Atkinson Hyperlegible\nlink\nDistinct and modern, the Atkinson Hyperlegible typeface aims to deliver both legibility and readability\nlink\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), at least 2.2 billion people have a vision impairment. Major financial burdens can occur when people can’t read fluently or work to their full potential. For example, the WHO estimates that “losses associated with vision impairment from uncorrected myopia and presbyopia alone were estimated to be US$ 244 billion and US$ 25.4 billion, respectively.” Typeface design can help.\n\nWhen Braille Institute hired Applied Design Works to create a new brand identity and branding strategy to coincide with their 2019 centennial anniversary, the firm looked for a beautiful and functional font specifically designed for improved legibility and readability. Brad Scott and Elliott Scott of Applied Design Works were concerned about typefaces that look a little like old ransom notes, where each letter and number were dramatically different from each other. They wondered if, despite designers’ intentions, these typefaces could actually be more difficult to read for some people. They decided that no existing typeface met their legibility, readability, and branding goals. So they endeavored to create a new typeface called Atkinson Hyperlegible, named after the organization’s founder J. Robert Atkinson. The work would go on to be recognized with a 2019 Fast Company ‘Innovation by Design’ Award.\n\nAtkinson Hyperlegible uses circular shapes to reference Braille dots.\n\nTo learn more, visit From Rebranding to Readability with Atkinson Hyperlegible."

    "description": "Rokkitt was initiated by Vernon Adams when he was inspired by the type forms of a number of distinctive geometric slab serifs, sometimes called Egyptians, popular in the late nineteenth and early to mid twentieth centuries. In 1910 the Inland Type Foundry published Litho Antique and similar types were published by American Type Founders in the 1920s and Monotype Corporation in the 1930s. Rokkitt is intended for use as a display font, in headings and headlines, though it can also be used as an alternative to sans serif designs at text sizes.\n\nUpdate January 2017: Vernon Adams began the project in 2011, and developed the typeface until 2014. During 2016 Kalapi Gajjar completed Vernon's original work and released a substantial update with a full set of 9 weights, and support for more Latin languages.\n\nUpdate July 2019: The family has been converted into a variable font.\n\nUpdate January 2023: The family has now an italic.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/RokkittFont."

The family includes a Sans, Sans Condensed, Mono, and Serif and has excellent legibility in print, web, and mobile interfaces.\n\nPlex’s three designs work well independently and even better together. Use the Sans as a contemporary compadre, the Serif for editorial storytelling, or the Mono to show code snippets. The unexpectedly expressive nature of the italics gives you even more options for your designs. Currently, IBM Plex Sans supports Extended Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean and Thai."

    "description": "Taviraj is a serif Latin and looped Thai typeface that has a wide structure that ensures readability and legibility. It is well-suited for formal usage. Thai letters have thick and thin strokes, similar to the Latin, together with rounded and airy looped terminals. Taviraj is a 9 weight family that includes italics.\n\nTaviraj is a Thai word that refers to the last two kings of Krungsri Ayutthaya, the former capital of Thailand. People also metaphorically refer to Taviraj as the fall of a dynasty, and that is the reason why it appeared in the poem written by King Rama V regarding the situation of Siam being threatened by French expansionism, with his majesty expressing his sorrow towards the possibility of the end of his era. A traditional Thai style of typeface is called “farangses,” which means french, and Taviraj is in this genre. This contradiction highlights its origin.\n\nA similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ and ฎ ฏ is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. Taviraj takes a specific approach when dealing with the thick and thin strokes of Thai glyphs. Other type designers of Thai fonts may like to use this approach as a reference. Formal looped Thai typefaces have delicate details so care must be taken when expanding them to heavier weights, to retain all the details. The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks has been managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.\n\nThe Taviraj project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand.

The default style is a grotesque with straight stems. As the flair axis grows the straight grotesque terminals develop a swelling and become almost glyphic serifs and the joints become more idiosyncratic. The volume axis transforms the glyphic serifs to wedge-like ones.\n\nEach voice of Commissioner comes in a range of styles from Thin to Black including italics. The diverse proportions of lowercase and capitals add warmth and appeal to texts across sizes, while the different voices can express a variation in the typographic texture that ranges from delicate in text sizes to exuberant in larger sizes.\n\nTo contribute, please see github.com/kosbarts/Commissioner."

    "description": "Macondo. The first purpose of this typeface was to provide an original and systematized style of calligraphy adapted into a modern digital font. The forms are inspired by some illustrations created for a tarot card game, itself inspired by the work of Colombian literature Nobel prize winning author, Gabriel García Márquez, «Cien Años de Soledad». Early versions of this font were made in 1997, but recently in 2009 it was substantially improved. Macondo includes several cap swashes and other stylish alternates, and a sister family Macondo Swash Caps is also available."

The Softness axis controls the “wetness” or “inkiness” of the typeface. The Wonky axis controls the manual substitution of “wonky” characters, such as the lean of the h, n, and m glyphs in the Roman, and the flagged ball terminals of the b, d, h, k, l, v, and w glyphs of the Italic.\n\nTo contribute, please see github.com/undercasetype/Fraunces.\n\nWonky, goofy, playful, elegant and a workhorse: Meet a new breed of “Old Style” typeface\nlink\n\nFraunces is a variable font that offers a variety of styles for text and display typography.\n\nIn 2018, Google Fonts commissioned Flavia Zimbardi and Phaedra Charles of Undercase Type to make a new display typeface that would demonstrate the power and promise of variable fonts with a sense of humor.\n\nTheir solution to this challenge is inspired by the early 20th century typefaces such as Windsor, Souvenir, and the Cooper Series.\n\nFraunces Black Soft Wonky at 14pt\n\n“Fraunces probably leans a little more (pun intended) towards the mannerism in Windsor than any of the others, but they all have some qualities common with each other. Those typefaces were meant to evoke a hand-drawn quality more appropriate for display advertising. The leaning ‘n’ in Windsor is a very distinctive characteristic of this style and is probably the most direct comparison. Fraunces does something unique by creating a design space that incorporates both heavy inky qualities, as well as thinner, more refined and delicate qualities seen in the lighter weights of Windsor. The italic pairing for Fraunces is also very distinct and draws influences from Cooper Nouveau, which blends Art Nouveau influences,” said Phaedra Charles.\n\nUsing variable font technology gives more flexibility; “Fraunces embraces the new variable font technology with four axes–softness, weight, wonk, and optical size–making its use much more versatile and customizable than what any typeface released in the 1970’s.”\n\nTo learn more, read Wonky, goofy, playful, elegant and a workhorse: Meet a new breed of “Old Style” typeface."

    "description": "Khand is a family of compact mono-linear fonts with very open counter forms. Developed for display typography, the family is primarily intended for headline usage. Its letterforms are dynamic, and everything is designed according to a modular system. All of its shapes bear a strong commonality to one another, but the typeface strikes a good balancing act and avoids too much repetitiveness. The lighter styles are suitable for short paragraphs of running text, while the heavier styles have been optimized for headlines or single word settings.\n\nThe base character height in the Khand fonts is ‘big on the body.’ Across a line of text, the consonantal forms take up the majority of vertical space. Vowel marks above and below have been shortened – keeping these to a minimum allows for lines of text to be set more closely together vertically. The reduction of interlinear space is paramount for successful headline typesetting, and Khand performs much better in display applications than similar fonts with more elongated vowel marks. Because of their reduced height, the typeface’s vowel mark forms have been simplified somewhat out of necessity, but this stylistic reduction is in-keeping with the modular feeling of the typeface’s overall design. Dot-shaped marks appear rounded in order to help maintain their differentiation from other marks.\n\nKhand’s Devanagari component was designed by Sanchit Sawaria and Jyotish Sonowal. The Latin component was designed by Satya Rajpurohit. To contribute, see github.com/itfoundry/khand"

The fonts were originally commissioned by Paula Scher, Pentagram and designed by Jeremy Mickel, MCKL for the new Red Hat identity.\n\nRed Hat is a fresh take on the geometric sans genre, taking inspiration from a range of American sans serifs including Tempo and Highway Gothic. The Display styles are low contrast and spaced tightly, with a large x-height and open counters. The Text styles have a slightly smaller x-height and narrower width for better legibility, are spaced more generously, and have thinned joins for better performance at small sizes. The two families can be used together seamlessly at a range of sizes.\n\nThe family has been upgraded to variable fonts with a weight axis (Light to Bold) in June 2021.\n\nThe November 2024 update addresses a frequently reported weight issue. The Medium and SemiBold weights now have slightly different weight compared to the previous version, ensuring better weight distribution within the design space and improved fluidity in the variable font.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/RedHatOfficial/RedHatFont"

Derived from Western Greek, attested in Rome in the 7th century BCE. In the common era, numerous European languages adopted the Latin script along with Western Christian religion, the script disseminated further with European colonization of the Americas, Australia, parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific. New letters, ligatures and diacritical marks were gradually added to represent the sounds of various languages.

Created in the 9th century. Traditionally attributed to Saint Cyril, a monk from Thessaloniki working in Bulgaria, after earlier creation of the Glagolitic script. Sometimes attributed to Clement of Ohrid, a student of Saint Cyril’s. Initially used for Old Church Slavonic. Reformed in 1708 by Russian tsar Peter the Great.

Used to write the Greek language since the 8th century BCE. Also used to write other languages like Urum, Albanian Tosk, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish. Some symbols are also used in scientific notation. Derived from Phoenician. First “true alphabet”, with distinct letters for consonants and vowels. Standardized in the 4th century BCE by Eucleides. Has 24 letters. Some letter variants (sigma: σ/ς) have positional significance in the Greek language, other variants only differ in meaning in scientific notation (e.g. pi: π/ϖ). The Greek language used to be written in polytonic spelling, with three accents on vowels. In 1982, Greece introduced monotonic spelling with a single diacritic. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a."

    "description": "Shippori Mincho is an old-style Mincho style created to provide novel writers in Japan a beautiful Mincho style for free. It is based on The Tokyo Tsukiji Type Foundry No. 5 Mincho style, which had a great influence on the Japanese Mincho style, which is widely used today.\n\nThe Regular was originally designed for long-form text setting in novels and the Extra Bold was originally designed for titles and headlines. Eventually it became a family of 5 weights from Regular to Extra Bold.\n\nShippori Mincho is designed to be beautiful even when the characters are enlarged so that they can be used widely from amateurs to editorial designers. Alternate characters are also included for those who are particular about the characters. The Kanji are based on the SIL licensed font, Genryu Mincho.\n\nShippori Mincho is the standard version of the font. Shippori Mincho B1 (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Shippori+Mincho+B1) has rounded corners and ink pooling.\n\nTo contribute to the project, visit github.com/fontdasu/ShipporiMincho"

The Arabic started with the concept of a curvy Arabic typeface inspired by the beauty of Naskh and drawn as if with a brush instead of the traditional bamboo pen. The idea took form with wide counters that improve readability at smaller text sizes, and has subtle details that make it a great display face at larger sizes. El Messiri current comes in 4 weights (Light, Regular, SemiBold and Bold) and the Arabic component has a wide glyph set that supports the Arabic, Farsi and Urdu languages.\n\nThe font has been upgraded to a variable font with a weight axis (Regular to Bold) in August 2021.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/Gue3bara/El-Messiri"

The Art Center aims to gather diverse artistic personalities in order to create new and enriching situations. Based on that idea, Syne is an exploration of atypical associations of weights and styles.\n\nSyne Regular is the starting point of the family. It is quite an archetypal geometric sans-serif, giving the art center a practical asset for their daily use. When getting bolder, the typeface also gets wider, forcing radical graphic design choices.\n\nCheckout the other two members of this heteroclite family: Syne Mono and Syne Tactile.\n\nA Greek script designed by George Triantafyllakos has been added in March 2022.\n\nSyne was conceptualized by Bonjour Monde and designed by Lucas Descroix with the help of Arman Mohtadji.

It has a large height, short extenders, and a compact width for better screen use, and economy of space.\n\nThe family will comprise a regular, italic, and cursive, each in five weights and with smallcaps. Two italics — one will be called \"italic\", and the other \"cursive\" — are uncommon, but very useful. Ever tried emphasizing something already emphasized? Beyond that obvious example, there are other uses.\n\nSometimes a text needs a different flavor or feel. While one roman can work for a variety of texts, the companion italics don't always. In more classical or personal documents, a stiff, sober, modern and down-to-earth italic will never work. And in many essays, some of the fancier italics look ridiculous. Who said a roman needs only one companion?"

The ANRT workshop aimed to digitize Jacob’s font in order to show his work which moves from transitional to modern styles.\n\nBaskervville was designed by the ANRT students from 2017 (Alexis Faudot, Rémi Forte, Morgane Pierson, Rafael Ribas, Tanguy Vanlaeys and Rosalie Wagner), under the direction of Charles Mazé.

Its tall ascender, the most distinct characteristic of this type, takes a wide line space between lines and gives a graceful texture. Use Tangerine for titles or short texts at large sizes because of the short height of lowercase letters. Tangerine was named after a woman who encouraged Toshi to begin this work."

    "description": "Pridi means “joyful” in Thai. Pridi is a slab serif Latin and looped Thai typeface that is well-suited for both body text and display. The looped Terminal Thai is designed specifically within loopless terminal concepts, and works well with the slab serif Latin without adding any slabs to any Thai glyphs. This font can be used as a body text in various media such as magazines, advertisements, and other print media.\n\nA similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, and ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. Pridi has a specific approach to the thick and thin strokes of Thai glyphs. Other type designers of Thai fonts may like to use this approach as a reference. Informal looped Thai typefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to formal ones, and this allows designers to extend the font to heavier weights. The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks need to be managed carefully, because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.\n\nThe Pridi project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand.

The new Baloo 2 includes additional glyphs, engineering improvements, and has been extended to five weights, ranging from the light footed Regular to the affable ExtraBold. The lighter weights retain Baloo’s characteristic bounce, but they do so slightly, infusing life into each word. This allows the new family to freely fraternise with texts of all sizes and temperaments — be it short bursts or copious reams, demanding headlines or whispering bylines. Carefree yet confident, sprightly yet versatile, the renewed family of Baloo promises to bring warmth to every project.\n\nThe Baloo 2 project consists of ten font families with unique local names for each of the nine Indic scripts plus Arabic (Baloo Bhaijaan 2). Each family supports one Indic/Arabic script plus Latin, Latin Extended, and Vietnamese.\n\nIt took a team of committed type designers to rear Baloo and raise it to be the typeface we love. The Gurmukhi is designed by Shuchita Grover; Bangla by Noopur Datye and Sulekha Rajkumar; Odia by Yesha Goshar, Manish Minz, and Shuchita Grover; Gujarati by Noopur Datye and Supriya Tembe; Kannada by Divya Kowshik and Shuchita Grover; Telugu by Maithili Shingre and Omkar Shende; Malayalam by Maithili Shingre and Unnati Kotecha; and Tamil by Aadarsh Rajan. Baloo Devanagari and Latin are collaboratively designed by Ek Type. Font engineering and type design assistance by Girish Dalvi.\n\nTo contribute to the project, visit github.com/EkType/Baloo2"

The first version of the font was done in 8 hours. I recently redid this fastfont from scratch, some glyphs have changed greatly but most of them I did not touch – just polished. Neucha very strong in terms of energy and I love it. Neucha translated from the Russian language means “not knowing how to create fonts right”."

It is a highly legible and well-balanced design sans serif. In order to make the kanji more clear and identifiable, the letterforms are simplified by omitting hane (hook) and geta (the vertical lines extending beyond horizontal strokes at the bottom of kanji). Counters and other spaces are finely adjusted so that the overall balance of the type is not impaired even with the use in relatively large size. The kana are made slightly smaller than the kanji to give a good rhythm and flow when setting long texts in the lighter weights.\n\nUDGothic includes full-width kana. UDPGothic includes proportional-width kana.\n\nTo contribute to the project, visit github.com/googlefonts/morisawa-biz-ud-gothic\n\nMorisawa BIZ Universal Design (UD) Japanese fonts added to Google Fonts and Google Workspace\nlink\n\nAs part of our larger effort to make great type accessible in more languages, Google Fonts is pleased to announce that the Japanese type foundry Morisawa has made 2 BIZ Universal Design (UD) font families available on Google Fonts, under the SIL Open Font License. These Gothic and Mincho designs, available in regular and bold weights and proportional and full width styles, are now also available in Google Workspace.\n\n“Having these fonts available in Japan allows Google Education to align with the most widely used fonts in education publishing in Japan,” said Stuart Miller, Head of Marketing for Google Education in Asia Pacific (APAC). “This makes it easier for partners to collaborate with Google Education. It also ensures a more consistent, inclusive, delightful experience for the millions of teachers and students that use Google tools.”\n\nDrawing on extensive end-user evaluation, the BIZ UD typefaces were developed using the principles of universal design (UD) to ensure legibility (the ease of differentiating individual characters) and readability (the ease of reading text overall). BIZ UD fonts are especially suited for conveying text accurately—for example, in educational settings, corporate communication environments, and other places that use ICT.\n\nTo learn more, read Morisawa BIZ Universal Design (UD) Japanese fonts added to Google Fonts and Google Workspace."

    "description": "Programmers use a lot of symbols, often encoded with several characters. For the human brain, sequences like ->, <= or := are single logical tokens, even if they take two or three characters on the screen. Your eye spends a non-zero amount of energy to scan, parse and join multiple characters into a single logical one. Ideally, all programming languages should be designed with full-fledged Unicode symbols for operators, but that’s not the case yet.\n\nFira Code is an extension of the Fira Mono font containing a set of ligatures for common programming multi-character combinations. This is just a font rendering feature: underlying code remains ASCII-compatible. This helps to read and understand code faster. For some frequent sequences like .. or //, ligatures allow us to correct spacing.\n\nTo contribute, see https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode."

The VT320 glyphs were designed with a nonrectangular pixel aspect ratio to fit the way the terminal scanned the CRT, so for this VT323 variation I had Python munge the locations and attempt to emulate the way the electron beam actually illuminated the phosphor and smeared the pixels horizontally on the terminal's CRT, so it looks more like what the actual glyph looked like on the screen. Python then drew the proper pixels into a 1:1 pixel grid as a monochrome PNG, which FontForge autoscanned into outlines. I have attempted to support most of the glyphs available on the VT320, but that is a limited set to begin with, so please don't be disappointed that I haven't supported Esperanto or Riograndenser Hunsrückisch or whatever.\n\nThere is another earlier variation called \"VT321\" that uses a more standard 1:1 pixel drawing technique, if you want to grab that as well. I personally like VT323 better, and actually use it as my terminal font when cruising on the command line."

The letter forms are characterized by an attention getting and strong contrast between the very heavy vertical shapes and the thin horizontal ones. The contrast of the design means that it will be most useful when set from medium to large sizes."

    "description": "CBC/Radio-Canada is Canada's national public broadcaster. Their mandate is to inform, enlighten and entertain, in order to strengthen Canadian culture on radio, television and digital platforms.\n\nThe Radio-Canada font was created in 2017 by Montreal-based designer and typographer Charles Daoud, in collaboration with Coppers and Brasses and Alexandre Saumier Demers. It was designed specifically for CBC/Radio-Canada as a brand unifying information font for all the Public Broadcaster’s platforms. Fittingly, for a Public Broadcaster, this is a peoples’ font and the humanistic style stands out with distinctive angles and subtle curves. Its x-height ensures excellent legibility and respects digital accessibility standards, making it very effective when used in continuous text.\n\nIn 2018, the Radio-Canada font won three awards, in the Font Design category at Communication Arts Typography, Applied Arts Design Annual and at Grand Prix Grafika.\n\nSeveral optimizations saw the light of day in 2021. The number of supported languages has increased from 106 to 317 Latin languages. In 2023, Jacques Le Bailly (Baron von Fonthausen) expanded the font to include the support of Indigenous languages.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/cbcrc/radiocanadafonts.\n\nTo learn more, read You can now use Radio-Canada’s brand typeface: The award-winning variable font comes to Google Fonts (English), Voici Radio-Canada, la police de caractères du diffuseur public canadien, plusieurs fois primée et maintenant disponible sur Google Fonts (French)."

    "description": "Playfair is a transitional design. In the European Enlightenment in the late 18th century, broad nib quills were replaced by pointed steel pens as the popular writing tool of the day. Together with developments in printing technology, ink, and paper making, it became fashionable to print letterforms of high contrast and delicate hairlines that were increasingly detached from the written letterforms. This design lends itself to this period, and while it is not a revival of any particular design, it takes influence from the designs of John Baskerville and from ‘Scotch Roman’ designs.\n\nThis typeface was initially published in 2011, and had a major update in 2017. Being a Display (large size) design in the transitional genre, functionally and stylistically it can accompany Georgia or Gelasio for body text. It was succeeded in 2023 by the complete Playfair design, which as a variable font includes body text designs in the optical size axis.\n\nThis is the Small Cap sibling family to the main Playfair Display family. The main family downloaded font files include a full set of small caps, common ligatures, and discretionary ligatures.\n\nThe Playfair project is led by Claus Eggers Sørensen, a type designer based in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

Mitr is a sans serif Latin and loopless Thai typeface that combines senses of organic and humanist sans serif designs with rounded terminals. It has a wide structure and airy negative space that preserves legibility and readability. Mitr is a novel and friendly typeface that is suitable for casual usage such as celebration cards, magazines, and posters.\n\nA similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, or ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. Mitr has a specific approach to the thick and thin strokes of Thai glyphs. Other type designers may consider this font as an example when developing new fonts. Informal looped Thai typefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to formal ones, and this allows type designers to extend them to heavier weights. The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks have been managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.\n\nThe Mitr project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand.

The main design features are the narrow proportions, that allow for economical typesetting, the moderate aperture and the observable contrast. These create some notable traits: Neutrality, clarity, and swiftness.\n\nIn 2011 this typeface by Andrijbecame a winner of the Ukrainian Type Design Competition Mystetsky Arsenal. The judges sought designs with three main criteria: Hitting the zeitgeist, being practical, and feeling Ukrainian. Andrij's winning entry was crowned with the name Arsenal, and made publicly available under the SIL Open Font License."

There was careful attention to detail in removing unnecessary overlap between letters, which allows Handlee to be scaled down to very small sizes while still maintaining legibility.\n\nThe diaritics were purposefully designed at a slightly larger scale than normal to add to the ability to be scaled down. Also, the accents on the accented characters were not automatically generated but were rather hand placed individually to portray asymmetry and inconsistency that is typically found in handwriting.\n\nAll of the little details and careful considerations in Handlee make it the perfect font for any project."

    "description": "Playfair is well suited for general purpose typesetting. Playfair can be interpolated in three dimensions: Width, Weight and Optical Size.\n\nThe optical size axis is the most extreme of the axes. Along that axis you can seamlessly change the letterforms from the extremely small Agate (5pt) to the extremely big Needlepoint (1200pt). The Agate has a very low contrast between the thickest and thinnest parts of its strokes, in fact the contrast is even slightly negative, meaning the the horisontal strokes are heavier than the vertical strokes. At the other end the Needlepoint is as high contrast as practically possible. The thinnest strokes are but a single unit wide, meaning that if you were to typeset in 1000 points using a Needlepoint weight, the resulting thinnest strokes would be one point wide. The weight axis adds a second dimension by allowing you to seamlessly change from a light regular to a dark black.\n\nAn update in June 2023 slightly modifies the width axis, giving the text a narrower appearance.\n\nIn February 2025, a glyphset update improves the language support by adding African.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/Playfair."

    "description": "Abhaya Libre is the unicode compliant, complete libre version of the most widely used Sinhala typeface ‘FM Abhaya’ and includes Sinhala and Latin support. Designed in 1996, ‘FM Abhaya’ is an interpretation of the Sinhala letterpress typefaces from 1960s. The name ‘Abhaya’ is derived from the King Abhaya (474 BCE to 454 BCE) who reigned Sri Lanka from the ancient kingdom of Upatissa Nuwara.\n\n‘Abhaya Libre’ was completely redrawn from scratch based on FM Abhaya to comply with modern day usages in terms of web, tab and smaller sizes for smartphones. Available in 5 weights, Abhaya Libre enables designers to build sophisticated typographic layouts by using lighter weights for body text and heavier weights for headlines and subheadings. Each of these weights contains 925 glyphs that enables clean and precise rendering for Sinhala, Pali and Sanskrit texts. Compact ‘Da’ forms can be enabled by using stylistic sets. The Latin characters, that match the aesthetics of ‘Abhaya Libre Sinhala’, which was inspired by the style of the original Sinhala with an eminent contrast between distinctive strokes that go from thick to thin and was further modified to co-exist with the visual logics of Latin typefaces. The ductus references according to the lines of a Didone typeface add a touch of Sinhala form to certain terminations. Large counters have been added along with small ascenders and descenders for optimized screen viewing.\n\nThe project is led by Mooniak, a small type foundry based in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in collaboration with Pushpananda Ekanayake. The Latin part is designed by Sol Matas. Initial development and release was funded by Google Fonts in 2015.

    "description": "The Charles Bluemlein Script Collection is an intriguing reminder of the heady days of hand lettering and calligraphy in the United States. From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs.\n\nAlejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein."

Developed in 1913 in China to be used for Mandarin Chinese transliteration alongside the Latin-based Wade–Giles system. Also called Mandarin Phonetic Symbols or Zhuyin (注音). Bopomofo is an official transliteration system in Taiwan, used in dictionaries, books, newspapers and journals to annotate the Taiwanese pronunciation of Chinese Han characters, and in electronic input methods. Largely replaced by Pinyin romanization in the People’s Republic of China. Also used as the primary script for Taiwan’s minority languages like Atayal, Taroko, Paiwan and Yami. Has 21 onset consonants, 16 rhymes, and 4 tone marks.

Created in the 9th century. Traditionally attributed to Saint Cyril, a monk from Thessaloniki working in Bulgaria, after earlier creation of the Glagolitic script. Sometimes attributed to Clement of Ohrid, a student of Saint Cyril’s. Initially used for Old Church Slavonic. Reformed in 1708 by Russian tsar Peter the Great. Extended by the Soviet Union in the 20th century to write over 50 languages throughout Eastern Europe and Asia (some of those languages switched to Latin after 1991). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nGreek\nlink\n\nGreek (Ελληνικά) is a European bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right (11 million users). Used to write the Greek language since the 8th century BCE. Also used to write other languages like Urum, Albanian Tosk, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish. Some symbols are also used in scientific notation. Derived from Phoenician. First “true alphabet”, with distinct letters for consonants and vowels. Standardized in the 4th century BCE by Eucleides. Has 24 letters. Some letter variants (sigma: σ/ς) have positional significance in the Greek language, other variants only differ in meaning in scientific notation (e.g. pi: π/ϖ). The Greek language used to be written in polytonic spelling, with three accents on vowels. In 1982, Greece introduced monotonic spelling with a single diacritic. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a."

But in fact Istok fonts are now very far from this origin. Contours of the font are designed in the freely distributable font editor, FontForge.\n\nMost glyphs are manually hinted with the aim to be rendered on LCD displays. I used xgridfit as a tool for programming truetype instructions. Less frequently utilized symbols have automatic instructions produced by FontForge autohinting, until manual hinting can be done. Manual and automatic instructions are intended to look homogeneous.\n\nThe original sources and truetype fonts are available at code.google.com/p/istok and this 'Web' version has modified vertical metrics.\n\nUpdated: June 2014 to version 1.0.2g"

    "description": "Lalezar is an Arabic and Latin display typeface for popular culture.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s a genre of filmmaking emerged in Iran which was commonly known as Film-Farsi. The main focus of the films produced in this period was on popular subjects such as romances, musicals and unrealistic heroic characters. The movie posters designed to represent these films were also intended to exaggerate these elements by the use of provocative imagery and a particular type of display lettering. These bold and dynamic letterforms were so popular and widely used that perhaps one can consider them the most significant component of film posters in that period.\n\nLalezar is an attempt to revive the appealing qualities in this genre of lettering and transform them into a modern Arabic display typeface and a suitable Latin companion. Although the main inspiration comes from a style of lettering that was used to represent the Persian language, here the objective is to design a typeface that can be used for most of the languages that use the Arabic script for their written communication.\n\nThe Lalezar project is led by Borna Izadpanah, a type designer based in London, UK.

    "description": "Hind Vadodara is a family of five Gujarati fonts, which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. Hind Multi-Script is a type system providing nine stylistically-matching font families – one for each of the following writing systems used in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka: Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, and Sinhala. In addition to Gujarati, the Hind Vadodara fonts also include Latin-script characters.\n\nDeveloped explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. Most of these strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. Additionally, Hind’s letterforms feature open apertures and counterforms. The entire family feels very legible when used to set text.\n\nThe Gujarati and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that the height of the Gujarati base characters is more or less at the same visual height that the Latin capital letters share. The exact height of the Gujarati characters increases vis à vis the capital height as the family increases in weight, just as the Latin lowercase does. Each font in the Hind Vadodara family has 851 glyphs, which include many unique Gujarati conjuncts. These ensure full support for the writing of the Gujarati language. The Latin component’s character set is Adobe Latin 3, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western European languages.\n\nHind Vadodara is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding. Hitesh Malaviya designed Hind Vadodara for ITF, who first published the fonts in 2015. Hind Vadodara is named after Vadodara, a city in Gujarat, India.\n\nThe Hind Vadodara project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India.

Cormorant was conceived, drawn, spaced, kerned, programmed, interpolated, and produced in its entirety by Christian Thalmann of Catharsis Fonts. For an illustrated presentation and description of the family, please visit its Behance page.\n\nWhile this project was heavily inspired by Claude Garamont's immortal legacy, Christian did not use any specific font as a starting point or direct reference for the designs. Most glyphs were drawn from scratch; when he needed guidance on a specific character, he searched for the term Garamond and skimmed through the results for a general impression.\n\nHe is grateful to the creative souls on the Typophile, TypeDrawers and Typografie forums, and Github, for a wealth of knowledge about type design, and for providing a large amount of excellent feedback on Cormorant during its development. He also thanks the tireless folks at Glyphs, in particular Rainer Erich Scheichelbauer of Schriftlabor and Georg Seifert. Special thanks go to Dave Crossland and Google Fonts for making the libre release of this font family possible through generous funding of the development process.\n\nThe Cormorant project is led by Christian Thalmann, a type designer based in Zurich, Switzerland.

The focus is on clear, easy-to-perceive letterforms that will not be readily confused with one another.\n\nStarting with an initial draft of a basic lowercase Latin alphabet by Victor Gaultney, Annie Olsen refined the design and added over 4,700 glyphs, including a complete extended Cyrillic set.\n\nA sans serif font is preferred by some literacy personnel for teaching people to read. Its forms are simpler and less cluttered than those of most serif fonts. For years, literacy workers have had to make do with fonts that were not really suitable for beginning readers and writers. In some cases, literacy specialists have had to tediously assemble letters from a variety of fonts in order to get all of the characters they need for their particular language project, resulting in confusing and unattractive publications. Andika addresses those issues.\n\nThe font has been upgraded in May 2022. This upgrade gives additional weight styles and expands the glyphset to support full Latin and Cyrillic characters sets. Rendering is also much improved.\n\nRead more at software.sil.org/andika\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/silnrsi/font-andika.\n\nSIL International recently released three typefaces for lesser-served writing systems (Tai Viet, Yi, Lepcha) used in Asia. SIL has also created Andika, which is specially designed to maximize legibility for new readers.\n\nSIL and lesser-served languages\nlink\n\nSIL International has a team of type designers who specialize in creating typefaces for lesser-served or non-dominant language communities. These are communities that exist alongside larger, more prominent language communities such as Chinese, English, or Arabic. These relatively smaller communities may have their own script, or they may have sounds in their language that are not represented in the script used by the majority language. Some non-dominant languages are endangered. According to UNESCO, about 40% of the estimated 7,000 languages are at risk of extinction.\n\nWithout typefaces, these language communities can't survive online.\n\nTo learn more, read New SIL Typefaces: Expanding type for legibility and lesser-served languages"

    "description": "Zen Old Mincho is a Japanese mincho (serif) typeface with a classic design. This font family started with the regular (400) weight, and bold and black weights were added due to huge demand. The wide range of weights means while the design is intended for text usage, it also works well in large sizes.\n\nTo contribute to the project, visit github.com/googlefonts/zen-oldmincho\n\nZen Old Mincho はベーシックな本文用の日本語明朝体ファミリーです このフォントファミリーには、はじめは「Regular」の太さしかありませんでしたが、多くの要望にお応えして、他のウェイトも追加しました。使える太さの範囲が広いため、本文用だけでなく、その他さ まざまな場面やメディアでご利用いただけます。\n\nこのプロジェクトに参加して貢献したい方は、次の URL をご参照ください。 github.com/googlefonts/zen-oldmincho\n\nSay Hello to our big new Japanese collection with Zen Fonts: Learn about the complex beauty of Japanese fonts\nlink\n\nIn 2019, Google Fonts started an ambitious project to expand its font library with a variety of typeface designs for Japanese. At that point Google Fonts had fewer than 10 Japanese families, most of which were basic Mincho (serif) and gothic (sans) designs. Since then the collection of Japanese fonts within the library has grown, now with 38 font families from 18 designers, in a variety of styles – from formal text types to fun display fonts. All these Japanese fonts are now live on Google Fonts for anyone to test out and use in any project.\n\nThe Zen Fonts collection is the largest set of Japanese fonts on Google Fonts\nlink\n\nAs part of this larger effort to expand Japanese offerings, Google Fonts collaborated with type designer Yoshimichi Ohira to open his prestigious collection of Zen Fonts typefaces to the public. With 23 Japanese and three Latin fonts in various styles of mincho (serif), gothic (sans serif), maru (rounded), and display styles, the Zen Fonts collection is now the largest set of Japanese fonts in Google Fonts’ expansive library, and is also available in Adobe Fonts. Check out The Story of Zen Fonts - interview with Yoshimichi Ohira to learn more.\n\nTo learn more, read:\nSay Hello to our big new Japanese collection with Zen Fonts (English)\nThe Story of Zen Fonts - interview with Yoshimichi Ohira (English)\nZenフォント: 新しい日本語フォントコレクションの登場 - 日本語フォントの複雑な美しさについて - (Japanese)\nZenフォントのおはなし：大平善道さんとのインタビュー (Japanese)"

It was originally inspired by some work I was doing for the FreeFont project in designing a Kayah Li range for FreeMono. The Latin alphabet is using the same kinds of strokes and curves as the Kayah Li glyphs, and thus Jura was born. It has been expanded to include glyphs for the Cyrillic and Greek alphabets as well.\n\nThe original Kayah Li glyphs have been included in this font. Note that glyphs for writing mainstream Burmese are not and never have been a part of this font.\n\nThe Jura family has an unfortunate name clash with Ed Merritt’s Jura serif font.

Most strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. Additionally, Hind Guntur’s letterforms feature open apertures and counterforms. The entire family feels very legible when used to set text.\n\nHind Guntur is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding.

Some uppercase glyphs are copied to their lowercase slots, where other lowercase glyphs such as the a, e, and r, are scaled up to uppercase heights. This motif allows for a vast array of setting possibilities.\n\nThough intended for display, Syncopate does work well for limited text runs. The letter forms are a modern and stylish sans serif inspired by the many trendy sans serif typefaces that are so prevalent today. The lighter weight and wide body impart a certain level of elegance, while the unicase approach keeps the look lively and fresh.\n\nA true bold was added in April 2011."

Learn how changing fonts can change comprehension.\n\nA child struggles to read and understand their homework assignment. An adult re-reads a news article and still doesn’t understand what it’s about. Both readers end up frustrated and feeling like there is something wrong with them. Thankfully there might be a simple answer. Dr. Bonnie Shaver-Troup thinks fonts are part of the problem and the solution to many reading problems.\n\n“We have a global reading crisis and we can change much of it by delivering fonts that are optimized for the visual field and for the individual. The answer is hidden in plain sight. It’s the font,” said Shaver-Troup.\n\nChange the font, change the outcome\nlink\n\nWhile working as an educational therapist in Silicon Valley, Shaver-Troup helped students with dyslexia and other reading problems to learn to read. She experimented by changing the spacing between certain letters in their reading assignments, and found that it improved their reading and comprehension. According to Shaver-Troup, the issue wasn’t in her students’ minds, it was with the letterforms they saw on the screen or paper.\n\n“The majority of the reading problems, including dyslexia, are not cognitive or phonological. They are visual or perceptual. Our testing has a built-in design flaw. We use fonts to deliver text for reading that are too tight for efficient or successful visual processing. Then we get poor results, suggesting the reading issue is phonological or cognitive. If we change the font to the tested optimized font fit, then we change the outcome,” she explained.\n\nTo learn more, read:\nClean and clear: making reading easier with Lexend (English)\nPartnering to change how the world reads (English)\nEine Partnerschaft mit dem Ziel, das Leseerlebnis weltweit zu verändern: Erweiterung von Lexend um verschiedene Schriftstärken (German)"

    "description": "In the crowded urban environment, space for signage is always at a premium. From crummy liquor stores to majestic theaters, sometimes signs have nowhere to go but up.\n\nBungee is a font that celebrates urban signs that stack the Latin alphabet, one letter on top of the other, in order to make dramatic use of limited space. Following their lead, Bungee typesets horizontally and vertically, so it is always ready to take your text in a new direction.\n\nBungee’s letterforms were designed to reinforce a sense of verticality. Round characters like O and diagonal characters like A are straight-sided, and letters like L and I gain serifs in order to create vertical words with well-defined left and right edges.\n\nThis font uses the COLRv1, CPAL and SVG tables. Please visit the gf-guide color page to learn more about Color Fonts technology.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/djrrb/Bungee\n\nBungee’s color fonts\nlink\n\nBungee was an early experimental color font, and has been updated as color font technology has developed over the past decade. Both Bungee Tint (flat colors) and Bungee Spice (gradients) contain multiple color palettes, so it is possible to create chromatic effects even in the most basic typesetting environments. Hopefully these fonts will help designers and developers explore the possibilities of what color fonts have to offer.\n\nThe Bungee family\nlink\n\nGoogle Fonts distributes seven variants of Bungee, including two color fonts:\n\nBungee\nBungee Hairline\nBungee Inline\nBungee Outline\nBungee Shade\nBungee Tint, a COLRv0 font\nBungee Spice, a COLRv1 font\n\nBungee’s downloadable releases also includes special layer fonts (for multicolor typesetting in environments where color fonts are not supported) and rotated fonts (for stacked typesetting in environments where vertical text is not supported).\n\nThe Bungee project is led by David Jonathan Ross, and thanks to support from Google and The Font Bureau, Bungee was released under the SIL Open Font License.\n\nIn 2023–24, Marte Verhaegen and Just van Rossum produced a major revision (v2), which includes an automated build process as well as many enhancements to the vertical features and color fonts."

This means it is a very condensed type.\n\nThe visual advantage of Econ—omica is that accomplishes this horizontal compression while keeping a strong personality. It is not a typical, neutral, sans serif. The open forms and tendency towards flattened curves allow it to be used in very small spaces while retaining high legibility.\n\nTo contribute to the project contact Vicente Lamónaca."

During this time India had a profound effect on his design philosophy and general worldview. Shrikhand is the culmination of three years absorbing the colourful and vibrant hand-painted lettering that can be seen on the streets in Gujarat. Big, bold, and unapologetic, Shrikhand is a display type that evolved from discussions with colleagues about how good the Gujarati script looks when it is free to be as curvaceous and expressive as possible.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/jonpinhorn/shrikhand"

The typeface eventually arrived in Greece, with the field press which came with Didot’s grandson Ambroise Firmin Didot, during the Greek Revolution in 1821.\n\nSince then the typeface enjoyed an unrivaled success as the type of choice for almost every kind of publication, until the last decades of the 20th century. Didot’s type was the base for a new font, GFS Didot (1994), which was designed by Takis Katsoulidis, and digitised by George Matthiopoulos, of the Greek Font Society. The typeface is accompanied by a matching Latin design, inspired by Hermann Zapf’s Palatino."

From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs.\n\nAlejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein."

The typeface is part of a brand redesign.\n\nLivvic was designed to capture LV=’s brand values and uniqueness. It is an open, friendly and somewhat quirky design. Corporate, yet still fresh and personal.\n\nThe Roman is an upright Italic, with some inspirations from handwriting. This gives livvic a strong, yet accessible character.\n\nThe Italic has matching metrics to the Roman. Although the Italic and Roman share a lot of similarities, the construction is different. It is gives the Italic some more panache.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/Fonthausen/Livvic."

Derived from Western Greek, attested in Rome in the 7th century BCE. In the common era, numerous European languages adopted the Latin script along with Western Christian religion, the script disseminated further with European colonization of the Americas, Australia, parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific. New letters, ligatures and diacritical marks were gradually added to represent the sounds of various languages.

Used for various languages across Eurasia and is used as the national script in various Slavic, Turkic, Mongolic and Iranic-speaking countries in Southeastern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, North Asia and East Asia, including Russian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Azerbaijani, Kazakh, Tajik, Kyrgyz, Bashkort, Chechen, Chuvash, Avar, Dargwa, Kabardian, Karakalpak, Kumyk, Lezgi, Ossetic, Pontic, Yakut, Buriat and many others. Created in the 9th century. Traditionally attributed to Saint Cyril, a monk from Thessaloniki working in Bulgaria, after earlier creation of the Glagolitic script. Sometimes attributed to Clement of Ohrid, a student of Saint Cyril’s. Initially used for Old Church Slavonic. Reformed in 1708 by Russian tsar Peter the Great. Extended by the Soviet Union in the 20th century to write over 50 languages throughout Eastern Europe and Asia (some of those languages switched to Latin after 1991).

Used to write the Greek language since the 8th century BCE. Also used to write other languages like Urum, Albanian Tosk, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish. Some symbols are also used in scientific notation. Derived from Phoenician. First “true alphabet”, with distinct letters for consonants and vowels. Standardized in the 4th century BCE by Eucleides. Has 24 letters. Some letter variants (sigma: σ/ς) have positional significance in the Greek language, other variants only differ in meaning in scientific notation (e.g. pi: π/ϖ). The Greek language used to be written in polytonic spelling, with three accents on vowels. In 1982, Greece introduced monotonic spelling with a single diacritic. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a."

The family includes a Sans, Sans Condensed, Mono, and Serif and has excellent legibility in print, web, and mobile interfaces.\n\nPlex’s three designs work well independently and even better together. Use the Sans as a contemporary compadre, the Serif for editorial storytelling, or the Mono to show code snippets. The unexpectedly expressive nature of the italics gives you even more options for your designs.

Petrona playfully maneuvers plenty of personal touches, without losing the essence of a design intended for legibility in digital and print media, from headlines to body text. Uppercase glyphs have heavy asymmetric serifs and arms with inverted angles, which combine with lowercase designs that share a big x-height, pronounced ascenders, and soft curves of low stroke contrast.\n\nFirst published in Google Fonts in November 2011 as a single style Roman design, it was completely redrawn in 2019 and 2020. It has evolved, and now offers a comprehensive range of weights, a complete set of corresponding italics, and an extended glyph set that supports over 200 Latin languages. A full set of small caps, plus ligatures, alternates, and all kinds of numerals, fractions, punctuations, symbols, and currencies are included. As a variable font, it has a Weight axis in both the roman and italic files. The previous swashy Q is still available, found in Stylistic Set 1. It is now a typeface that supplies everything needed for fine text typography.\n\nThe Petrona project is led by Ringo R. Seeber from Glyph Co, based in Brooklyn, NY.

Today, contrasted Sans are very rare, and only a few are successful.\n\nWhile digging in old specimens, we found three that immediately caught our attention: Doric Italic and Taylor Gothic from American Type Founders (1897), and Charter Oak from Keystone Type Foundry of Philadelphia (1906).\n\nRacing Sans is a current high contrast sans, paying tribute to this forgotten genre."

    "description": "Athiti is a Thai word for the Sun, and it is an informal sans Latin and loopless Thai typeface. The friendly personality is based on humanist calligraphy, and has an organic look and feel while preserving the traditional construction of Roman type. It all started with a desire to learn more about the origin of strokes in human handwriting. It is designed to reflect a trace of writing tools and convey its inspiration. The family consists of 6 weights that can be used in headlines or body text.\n\nThe outer curves contrast with the angled inner counter shapes, which distributes feelings of strength and softness at the same time. Athiti can be used with a mixture of formal and informal content, for example in educational work.\n\nA similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, or ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. A specific approach has been taken for dealing with thick and thin strokes in the Thai design. Other type designers may consider this font as an example when developing new fonts.\n\nInformal loopless Thai typefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to the formal looped style, and this allows type designers to extend loopless families to very black weights. Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture. Also, in this case, ink trapping is required when connecting two specific strokes of each glyph, and it has to be done carefully, as it has been in Athiti.\n\nThe Athiti project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand.

Nowadays, in 2020, Mincho and Gothic typefaces are exclusively used in smart phones, tablets and PC environment. We hope that the introduction of a round font will change the way people express their emotions and feelings, which have been missing from the analog and digital worlds, and the painful feeling of having too many Chinese characters in a font.\n\nThere are three weights, L, R and M. These vary only slightly in weight as we wanted to provide you with the ability to account for the difference in weight between different OS, browsers, and devices.\n\nTo contribute to the project, visit github.com/Kiwi-KawagotoKajiru/Kiwi-Maru"

These elegant typefaces, when combined in use, exude clarity and beauty for both on screen and printed materials.\n\nMarcellus is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support other scripts. More specifically, this release supports the following Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic. To contribute to the project contact Brian J. Bonislawsky."

Glegoo is slightly condensed, has a large x-height, short ascenders/descenders and large counterforms. These attributes all add up to help reading text, even in very small sizes. Its careful design and proper choice of weight generate a nice texture in paragraphs of text, but the design is also intended to work well when composing headlines with presence and elegance. Large usage will show off the delicate modulation of strokes that are in this font.\n\nUpdated August 2014: A Bold style was added, the family was hinted with ttfautohint, and a Devanagari subset was included.\n\nContribute to the project at github.com/etunni/glegoo"

Laila looks especially good in headlines. It is a display typeface, but it may also be used to set shorter passages of text, too.\n\nLaila’s Latin component has a high x-height and open counter forms. In terms of the thickness of its strokes, everything is mostly monolinear. The Devanagari component is even more fluid, appearing lively and graceful. The height is between the Latin x-height and capital height. The strokes thickness is a little lighter than in the Latin; in text blocks, texts set in each script will have similar color.\n\nHitesh Malaviya designed the Devanagari, and the Latin is by Jonny Pinhorn.

He is intrigued by the mysterious letters “K” and “R” with curly legs, and a handwritten note on old brown paper that says “Brygada.” He starts an archeological quest to research the origins of the font–and inspires a team to revive the font with 21st century software and a microscopic camera.\n\nIs this the plot line for a new “Indiana Jones” movie or the origin story for a remade digitized font?\n\nIt’s the latter. It’s the story of Brygada, a lost and forgotten 20th century typeface remade for the 21st century.\n\nHandwritten note with “Brygada” name in Polish\n\nIt was the summer of 2015 and Mr. Janusz Tryzno was the owner of the Book Art Museum of Łódź located in a 19th century villa in Łódź (pronounced “Woodge”), Poland. He dug through piles of font matrices (metal blocks with letter shapes used to cast letters) and metal plates wrapped in brown paper from the Polish National Type Foundry. After uncovering the Brygada matrices, he asked museum volunteers, Przemysław Hoffer and Borys Kosmynka, to examine the matrices to see if they could bring the font back to life.\n\nTo learn more about Brygada, visit: Reviving a forgotten font: Type detectives give life to Brygada(English), Rewitalizacja zapomnianej czcionki: nowe życie Brygady(Polish)."

The wide proportions and clean features aid legibility at small sizes, while the unusual letterforms provide enough character to be useful for display typography too.\n\nInitially designed by Ilya Yudin in 2010, it was carefully refined and expanded by Alexei Vanyashin into a wider range of weights (that made the bold style a little lighter) in January 2017. In September 2019, the family is now a variable font.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/cyrealtype/Podkova."

The Latin script component has serif letters. Both these, and the stroke terminals in the Devanagari letterforms are generally rounded in Karma’s design.\n\nKarma’s characters are economic in width, and the Latin sports a tall x-height. Although the knotted terminals in the Devanagari letterforms are closed, the general feeling of the Devanagari character set is open and airy. See the design of the ख (kha), छ (cha) and ध (dha), for example.\n\nJoana Correia designed Karma for the Indian Type Foundry, who first published the fonts in 2014."

    "description": "The Charles Bluemlein Script Collection is an intriguing reminder of the heady days of hand lettering and calligraphy in the United States. From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs.\n\nAlejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein."

    "description": "Rozha One is a very high contrast Open Source font, which currently offers support for the Devanagari and Latin scripts. Created primarily for display use, the extreme difference between its letters’ thick and thin strokes make it an excellent choice for large headlines and poster-sized graphics. The Indian Type Foundry released Rozha One in 2014; its Devanagari character set was designed by Tim Donaldson and Jyotish Sonowal. Shiva Nallaperumal designed the Latin.\n\nThe font’s Latin characters are drawn in a fat face ‘modern’ or ‘Didone’ style, similar to letters that were commonly used in 19th century advertising posters in the West. Rozha One’s Latin characters barely differentiate between upper and lowercase letter sizes; the x-height of its lowercase letters is so high – and the size of its capital letters so small – that these virtually blend into one another in a line of text. Nevertheless, the Devanagari letters are drawn in such a way that they harmonise with the font’s Latin very well in settings where texts in multiple languages sit alongside one another. The headline of the Devanagari base characters is the same thickness as the Latin letters’ serifs. Certain Devanagari letter strokes and vowel marks bare visually similarity to the font’s Latin letters. However, Rozha One does not appear Latinized or un-Devanagari.\n\nThe font includes 1,095 glyphs, offering full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written with the Devanagari script. When used in on-screen design environments, Rozha One should be used in very large pixel sizes. However in print, the design may be used in a broader range of sizes, perhaps even as small as at 16 or 18 points.\n\nThe Rozha project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India.

The Overpass Mono fonts are finely tuned to meet the requirements of today’s programmers.\n\nThe design of Overpass is an interpretation of the well-known “Highway Gothic” letterforms from the Standard Alphabets for Traffic Control Devices published by the U.S. Federal Highway Administration. Starting from those specifications, critical adjustments were made to the letterforms to create an optimal presentation at smaller sizes on-screen and later for display sizes, especially in the lighter weights.\n\nOverpass can be used for everything from extended passages of text in print and online, to UI design, posters, wayfinding signage, and environmental graphic design.\n\nDesigners: Delve Withrington, Dave Bailey, and Thomas Jockin\nTrueType Hinting: Jason Campbell\nDirection: Dave Crossland, Andy Fitzsimon, Jakub Steiner, and Ben Dubrovsky\nSpecial thanks: Aaron Bell for his diligence in preparing v4.0 for release and Michael Luton for his insight and support.\n\nTo contribute to the project, please visit https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/Overpass"

It was given financial support from the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications.\n\nThe fonts include standard Western, Central European and Cyrillic code pages, plus the characters of every title language in the Russian Federation. This makes them a unique and very important tool for modern digital communications.\n\nPT Serif is a transitional serif typeface with humanistic terminals. It is designed for use together with PT Sans, and is harmonized across metrics, proportions, weights and design.\n\nThe family consists of six styles: regular and bold weights with corresponding italics form a standard font family for basic text setting; two caption styles in regular and italic are for use in small point sizes.\n\nDesigned by Alexandra Korolkova, Olga Umpeleva and Vladimir Yefimov and released by ParaType in 2010."

    "description": "Lobster is one of the most popular web fonts, designed by Pablo Impallari. Pattaya is a version of Lobster extended into Thai, and supports Latin and all variations of the Thai script with an informal loopless design. However, vertical metrics (that effect line-spacing) had to be adjusted in order to support Thai vowels and tone marks, so this is published as a separate family.\n\nA similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ and ฏ, บ and ป, or ข and ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. Pattaya has a specific approach to the thick and thin strokes of Thai glyphs. Other type designers of Thai fonts may like to use this approach as a reference. Informal loopless Thai tyefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to formal ones, and this simplification has to be done properly in order to preserve the character of each glyph. The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks need to be managed carefully, because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.\n\nThe Pattaya project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand.

    "description": "Anek, as the meaning of the word suggests, is an exercise in multiplicity — multiple scripts designed in multiple weights and widths by multiple designers. A well-informed, conscientious and refreshing interpretation of India’s letter traditions, this family offers a versatile system that can meet the demands of a wide range of applications.\n\nIts expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep structures compact for that graphic texture. On the wide end of the spectrum, the extra legroom lets each letter yawn and stretch into their message. But it is in the boldest weights that Anek comes alive. Sharp terminals and tapered joineries sparkle amidst regimented forms, making this ideal for setting titillating headlines or that magnetic word-mark.\n\nAnek comes in ten scripts: Bangla, Devanagari, Kannada, Latin, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu. The shared aesthetics of this type-family are drawn from a collaboratively decided pool of visual features. At the same time, each script amalgamates influences from its own typographic culture as well as the perspectives of individual designers.\n\nThis project is designed, engineered and maintained by Ek Type; a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces. Contributors of this project are: Maithili Shingre (Anek Malayalam, Anek Kannada), Yesha Goshar (Anek Latin, Anek Odia), Kailash Malviya (Anek Devanagari), Aadarsh Rajan (Anek Tamil), Sulekha Rajkumar (Anek Bangla), Vaishnavi Murthy (Anek Kannada), Omkar Bhoir (Anek Telugu), Mrunmayee Ghaisas (Anek Gujarati), Mahesh Sahu (Anek Odia), and Sarang Kulkarni (Anek Gurmukhi). Project management and design assistance by Noopur Datye, and Font engineering and design assistance by Girish Dalvi.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/EkType/Anek\n\nMultiple scripts for multilingual India\nlink\nThe award-winning Anek variable font\nlink\nThe nine scripts have base characters in the center, with vowel signs and conjuncts that come above, below or next to them.\n\nThe Anek multi-script typeface for 9 Indian languages and Latin was made through a collaboration of 12 type designers working across 8 cities in India.\n\nHow did Ek Type win two type design awards (the TDC Certificate of Typographic Excellence and the D&AD Graphite Pencil) for their Anek multi-script typeface?\n\nThere were two key factors to their success:\n\nTeamwork: The team of 12 collaborated democratically.\nEquality: Giving equal value to each of the nine Indian writing systems (scripts) and Latin, while maintaining both common visual features and script-specific characteristics.\nTeamwork during lockdown\nlink\n\nGetting 12 people to collaborate while speaking in three languages (English, Hindi, and Marathi) and spread out in eight different Indian cities (Mumbai, Pune, Kalyan, Hinganghat, Baroda, Bengaluru, Bharampur, and Pali) is not an easy task.\n\nEk Type established a collaboration structure that fostered teamwork, while also giving designers the liberty to be creative.\n\nThe team consisted of Maithili Shingre, Yesha Goshar, Kailash Malviya, Aadarsh Rajan, Sulekha Rajkumar, Vaishnavi Murthy, Omkar Bhoir, Mrunmayee Ghaisas, Mahesh Sahu, Sarang Kulkarni, Noopur Datye, and Girish Dalvi.\n\nTen people focused on one script each, while the other two members worked on font engineering and project management. The designers focused on the script that was most familiar to them.\n\nVia three- to four-hour weekly video calls, team members annotated drawings with emojis, arrows, text, and other marks in their video conference platform. In between calls, the team collaborated online. The team made design decisions based on majority or unanimous votes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, most of the team had worked together at the Ek Type studio in Mumbai. Remote work created some unforeseen benefits. “Everyone had the time to venture in different directions, not getting colored by what the others were doing,” said Noopur Datye, co-founder and type designer at Ek Type.\n\nTo learn more, read Multilingual scripts for multilingual India."

It is a highly legible and well-balanced design sans serif. In order to make the kanji more clear and identifiable, the letterforms are simplified by omitting hane (hook) and geta (the vertical lines extending beyond horizontal strokes at the bottom of kanji). Counters and other spaces are finely adjusted so that the overall balance of the type is not impaired even with the use in relatively large size. The kana are made slightly smaller than the kanji to give a good rhythm and flow when setting long texts in the lighter weights.\n\nUDGothic includes full-width kana. UDPGothic includes proportional-width kana.\n\nTo contribute to the project, visit github.com/googlefonts/morisawa-biz-ud-gothic\n\nMorisawa BIZ Universal Design (UD) Japanese fonts added to Google Fonts and Google Workspace\nlink\n\nAs part of our larger effort to make great type accessible in more languages, Google Fonts is pleased to announce that the Japanese type foundry Morisawa has made 2 BIZ Universal Design (UD) font families available on Google Fonts, under the SIL Open Font License. These Gothic and Mincho designs, available in regular and bold weights and proportional and full width styles, are now also available in Google Workspace.\n\n“Having these fonts available in Japan allows Google Education to align with the most widely used fonts in education publishing in Japan,” said Stuart Miller, Head of Marketing for Google Education in Asia Pacific (APAC). “This makes it easier for partners to collaborate with Google Education. It also ensures a more consistent, inclusive, delightful experience for the millions of teachers and students that use Google tools.”\n\nDrawing on extensive end-user evaluation, the BIZ UD typefaces were developed using the principles of universal design (UD) to ensure legibility (the ease of differentiating individual characters) and readability (the ease of reading text overall). BIZ UD fonts are especially suited for conveying text accurately—for example, in educational settings, corporate communication environments, and other places that use ICT.\n\nTo learn more, read Morisawa BIZ Universal Design (UD) Japanese fonts added to Google Fonts and Google Workspace."

From crummy liquor stores to majestic theaters, sometimes signs have nowhere to go but up.\n\nBungee is a font that celebrates urban signs that stack the Latin alphabet, one letter on top of the other, in order to make dramatic use of limited space. Following their lead, Bungee typesets horizontally and vertically, so it is always ready to take your text in a new direction.\n\nBungee’s letterforms were designed to reinforce a sense of verticality. Round characters like O and diagonal characters like A are straight-sided, and letters like L and I gain serifs in order to create vertical words with well-defined left and right edges.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/djrrb/Bungee\n\nThe Bungee family\nlink\n\nGoogle Fonts distributes seven variants of Bungee, including two color fonts:\n\nBungee\nBungee Hairline\nBungee Inline\nBungee Outline\nBungee Shade\nBungee Tint, a COLRv0 font\nBungee Spice, a COLRv1 font\n\nBungee’s downloadable releases also includes special layer fonts (for multicolor typesetting in environments where color fonts are not supported) and rotated fonts (for stacked typesetting in environments where vertical text is not supported).\n\nThe Bungee project is led by David Jonathan Ross, and thanks to support from Google and The Font Bureau, Bungee was released under the SIL Open Font License.\n\nIn 2023–24, Marte Verhaegen and Just van Rossum produced a major revision (v2), which includes an automated build process as well as many enhancements to the vertical features and color fonts."

Shablon was designed 30 years ago in Iran, and is reinterpreted by Kourosh to incorporate contemporary techniques, aesthetics and of course some personal taste. While inspired by the spirit of Shablon, Jomhuria is a new typeface that stands on its own. The typeface designer Kourosh created an additional original Latin design that is tailored to harmonize with the aesthetics of the Persian/Arabic design.\n\nBeing made for big sizes means details matter. The positions of the dots remains faithful to their locations in Persian/Arabic calligraphy; this is an important factor of beauty in the writing system and is key to readability.\n\nThe Arabic script was designed by Kourosh Beigpour, and the Latin was designed by Eben Sorkin. The font is engineered by Lasse Fister, and the technicalities build upon those developed by Khaled Hosny for his “Amiri.”\n\nThe Latin is scaled to work best with the Arabic component.\n\nThe Jomhuria project is led by KB Studio, a type design foundry based in Los Angelese, USA.

The typeface is not a straightforward digitalization (it even couldn’t be as the early Latin alphabet didn’t include all the letters we use today) but more of a revival which keeps current needs and technologies in mind.\n\nAboreto has vertical stress, a feature more typical of later-century typefaces. Another uniqueness lies in the construction, because it is essentially a sans-serif typeface that has only occasional indication of serifs – either via the “hidden” serifs caused by stroke tapering or by slightly thickening the stroke endings. Aboreto comes in one weight - a high contrast regular that is on the thinner side.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/domija/Aboreto."

As a result, the Overlock typeface family is great for titles and short texts in magazine style layouts. It looks its very best at bigger sizes.

It was also selected in the 2nd Bienal Iberoamericana de Diseño, competition held in Madrid in 2010.\n\nAlegreya is a typeface originally intended for literature. Among its crowning characteristics, it conveys a dynamic and varied rhythm which facilitates the reading of long texts. Also, it provides freshness to the page while referring to the calligraphic letter, not as a literal interpretation, but rather in a contemporary typographic language.\n\nThe italic has just as much care and attention to detail in the design as the roman. The bold weights are strong, and the Black weights are really experimental for the genre. This is the Small Caps sister family that complements Alegreya, the main family.\n\nNot only does Alegreya provide great performance, but also achieves a strong and harmonious text by means of elements designed in an atmosphere of diversity.\n\nThe Alegreya type system is a \"super family\", originally intended for literature, and includes serif and sans serif sister families.\n\nDesigned by Juan Pablo del Peral for Huerta Tipográfica.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/huertatipografica/Alegreya."

Learn how changing fonts can change comprehension.\n\nA child struggles to read and understand their homework assignment. An adult re-reads a news article and still doesn’t understand what it’s about. Both readers end up frustrated and feeling like there is something wrong with them. Thankfully there might be a simple answer. Dr. Bonnie Shaver-Troup thinks fonts are part of the problem and the solution to many reading problems.\n\n“We have a global reading crisis and we can change much of it by delivering fonts that are optimized for the visual field and for the individual. The answer is hidden in plain sight. It’s the font,” said Shaver-Troup.\n\nChange the font, change the outcome\nlink\n\nWhile working as an educational therapist in Silicon Valley, Shaver-Troup helped students with dyslexia and other reading problems to learn to read. She experimented by changing the spacing between certain letters in their reading assignments, and found that it improved their reading and comprehension. According to Shaver-Troup, the issue wasn’t in her students’ minds, it was with the letterforms they saw on the screen or paper.\n\n“The majority of the reading problems, including dyslexia, are not cognitive or phonological. They are visual or perceptual. Our testing has a built-in design flaw. We use fonts to deliver text for reading that are too tight for efficient or successful visual processing. Then we get poor results, suggesting the reading issue is phonological or cognitive. If we change the font to the tested optimized font fit, then we change the outcome,” she explained.\n\nTo learn more, read:\nClean and clear: making reading easier with Lexend (English)\nPartnering to change how the world reads (English)\nEine Partnerschaft mit dem Ziel, das Leseerlebnis weltweit zu verändern: Erweiterung von Lexend um verschiedene Schriftstärken (German)"

Cormorant was conceived, drawn, spaced, kerned, programmed, interpolated, and produced in its entirety by Christian Thalmann of Catharsis Fonts. For an illustrated presentation and description of the family, please visit its Bēhance page.\n\nWhile this project was heavily inspired by Claude Garamont's immortal legacy, Christian did not use any specific font as a starting point or direct reference for the designs. Most glyphs were drawn from scratch; when he needed guidance on a specific character, he searched for the term Garamond and skimmed through the results for a general impression.\n\nHe is grateful to the creative souls on the Typophile, TypeDrawers and Typografie forums, and Github, for a wealth of knowledge about type design, and for providing a large amount of excellent feedback on Cormorant during its development. He also thanks the tireless folks at Glyphs, in particular Rainer Erich Scheichelbauer of Schriftlabor and Georg Seifert. Special thanks go to Dave Crossland and Google Fonts for making the libre release of this font family possible through generous funding of the development process.\n\nThe Cormorant project is led by Christian Thalmann, a type designer based in Zurich, Switzerland.

Learn how changing fonts can change comprehension.\n\nA child struggles to read and understand their homework assignment. An adult re-reads a news article and still doesn’t understand what it’s about. Both readers end up frustrated and feeling like there is something wrong with them. Thankfully there might be a simple answer. Dr. Bonnie Shaver-Troup thinks fonts are part of the problem and the solution to many reading problems.\n\n“We have a global reading crisis and we can change much of it by delivering fonts that are optimized for the visual field and for the individual. The answer is hidden in plain sight. It’s the font,” said Shaver-Troup.\n\nChange the font, change the outcome\nlink\n\nWhile working as an educational therapist in Silicon Valley, Shaver-Troup helped students with dyslexia and other reading problems to learn to read. She experimented by changing the spacing between certain letters in their reading assignments, and found that it improved their reading and comprehension. According to Shaver-Troup, the issue wasn’t in her students’ minds, it was with the letterforms they saw on the screen or paper.\n\n“The majority of the reading problems, including dyslexia, are not cognitive or phonological. They are visual or perceptual. Our testing has a built-in design flaw. We use fonts to deliver text for reading that are too tight for efficient or successful visual processing. Then we get poor results, suggesting the reading issue is phonological or cognitive. If we change the font to the tested optimized font fit, then we change the outcome,” she explained.\n\nTo learn more, read:\nClean and clear: making reading easier with Lexend (English)\nPartnering to change how the world reads (English)\nEine Partnerschaft mit dem Ziel, das Leseerlebnis weltweit zu verändern: Erweiterung von Lexend um verschiedene Schriftstärken (German)"

    "description": "Anek, as the meaning of the word suggests, is an exercise in multiplicity — multiple scripts designed in multiple weights and widths by multiple designers. A well-informed, conscientious and refreshing interpretation of India’s letter traditions, this family offers a versatile system that can meet the demands of a wide range of applications.\n\nIts expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep structures compact for that graphic texture. On the wide end of the spectrum, the extra legroom lets each letter yawn and stretch into their message. But it is in the boldest weights that Anek comes alive. Sharp terminals and tapered joineries sparkle amidst regimented forms, making this ideal for setting titillating headlines or that magnetic word-mark.\n\nAnek comes in ten scripts: Bangla, Devanagari, Kannada, Latin, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu. The shared aesthetics of this type-family are drawn from a collaboratively decided pool of visual features. At the same time, each script amalgamates influences from its own typographic culture as well as the perspectives of individual designers.\n\nThis project is designed, engineered and maintained by Ek Type; a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces. Contributors of this project are: Maithili Shingre (Anek Malayalam, Anek Kannada), Yesha Goshar (Anek Latin, Anek Odia), Kailash Malviya (Anek Devanagari), Aadarsh Rajan (Anek Tamil), Sulekha Rajkumar (Anek Bangla), Vaishnavi Murthy (Anek Kannada), Omkar Bhoir (Anek Telugu), Mrunmayee Ghaisas (Anek Gujarati), Mahesh Sahu (Anek Odia), and Sarang Kulkarni (Anek Gurmukhi). Project management and design assistance by Noopur Datye, and Font engineering and design assistance by Girish Dalvi.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/EkType/Anek\n\nMultiple scripts for multilingual India\nlink\nThe award-winning Anek variable font\nlink\nThe nine scripts have base characters in the center, with vowel signs and conjuncts that come above, below or next to them.\n\nThe Anek multi-script typeface for 9 Indian languages and Latin was made through a collaboration of 12 type designers working across 8 cities in India.\n\nHow did Ek Type win two type design awards (the TDC Certificate of Typographic Excellence and the D&AD Graphite Pencil) for their Anek multi-script typeface?\n\nThere were two key factors to their success:\n\nTeamwork: The team of 12 collaborated democratically.\nEquality: Giving equal value to each of the nine Indian writing systems (scripts) and Latin, while maintaining both common visual features and script-specific characteristics.\nTeamwork during lockdown\nlink\n\nGetting 12 people to collaborate while speaking in three languages (English, Hindi, and Marathi) and spread out in eight different Indian cities (Mumbai, Pune, Kalyan, Hinganghat, Baroda, Bengaluru, Bharampur, and Pali) is not an easy task.\n\nEk Type established a collaboration structure that fostered teamwork, while also giving designers the liberty to be creative.\n\nThe team consisted of Maithili Shingre, Yesha Goshar, Kailash Malviya, Aadarsh Rajan, Sulekha Rajkumar, Vaishnavi Murthy, Omkar Bhoir, Mrunmayee Ghaisas, Mahesh Sahu, Sarang Kulkarni, Noopur Datye, and Girish Dalvi.\n\nTen people focused on one script each, while the other two members worked on font engineering and project management. The designers focused on the script that was most familiar to them.\n\nVia three- to four-hour weekly video calls, team members annotated drawings with emojis, arrows, text, and other marks in their video conference platform. In between calls, the team collaborated online. The team made design decisions based on majority or unanimous votes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, most of the team had worked together at the Ek Type studio in Mumbai. Remote work created some unforeseen benefits. “Everyone had the time to venture in different directions, not getting colored by what the others were doing,” said Noopur Datye, co-founder and type designer at Ek Type.\n\nTo learn more, read Multilingual scripts for multilingual India."

Plex is an international typeface family designed to capture IBM’s brand spirit and history and to illustrate the unique relationship between mankind and machine—a principal theme for IBM since the turn of the century. The result is a neutral yet friendly Grotesque style typeface that balances design with the engineered details that make Plex distinctly IBM. The family includes a Sans, Sans Condensed, Mono, and Serif and has excellent legibility in print, web, and mobile interfaces.\n\nPlex’s three designs work well independently and even better together. Use the Sans as a contemporary compadre, the Serif for editorial storytelling, or the Mono to show code snippets. The unexpectedly expressive nature of the italics gives you even more options for your designs. Currently, IBM Plex Sans supports Extended Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean and Thai."

    "description": "Cormorant is a free display type family developed by Christian Thalmann. The project currently comprises a total of 45 font files spanning 9 different visual styles (Roman, Italic, Infant, Infant Italic, Garamond, Garamond Italic, Upright Cursive, Small Caps, and Unicase) and 5 weights (Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold.) Cormorant was conceived, drawn, spaced, kerned, programmed, interpolated, and produced in its entirety by Christian Thalmann of Catharsis Fonts. For an illustrated presentation and description of the family, please visit its Bēhance page.\n\nWhile this project was heavily inspired by Claude Garamont's immortal legacy, Christian did not use any specific font as a starting point or direct reference for the designs. Most glyphs were drawn from scratch; when he needed guidance on a specific character, he searched for the term Garamond and skimmed through the results for a general impression.\n\nHe is grateful to the creative souls on the Typophile, TypeDrawers and Typografie forums, and Github, for a wealth of knowledge about type design, and for providing a large amount of excellent feedback on Cormorant during its development. He also thanks the tireless folks at Glyphs, in particular Rainer Erich Scheichelbauer of Schriftlabor and Georg Seifert. Special thanks go to Dave Crossland and Google Fonts for making the libre release of this font family possible through generous funding of the development process.\n\nThe Cormorant project is led by Christian Thalmann, a type designer based in Zurich, Switzerland.

    "description": "Anek, as the meaning of the word suggests, is an exercise in multiplicity — multiple scripts designed in multiple weights and widths by multiple designers. A well-informed, conscientious and refreshing interpretation of India’s letter traditions, this family offers a versatile system that can meet the demands of a wide range of applications.\n\nIts expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep structures compact for that graphic texture. On the wide end of the spectrum, the extra legroom lets each letter yawn and stretch into their message. But it is in the boldest weights that Anek comes alive. Sharp terminals and tapered joineries sparkle amidst regimented forms, making this ideal for setting titillating headlines or that magnetic word-mark.\n\nAnek comes in ten scripts: Bangla, Devanagari, Kannada, Latin, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu. The shared aesthetics of this type-family are drawn from a collaboratively decided pool of visual features. At the same time, each script amalgamates influences from its own typographic culture as well as the perspectives of individual designers.\n\nThis project is designed, engineered and maintained by Ek Type; a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces. Contributors of this project are: Maithili Shingre (Anek Malayalam, Anek Kannada), Yesha Goshar (Anek Latin, Anek Odia), Kailash Malviya (Anek Devanagari), Aadarsh Rajan (Anek Tamil), Sulekha Rajkumar (Anek Bangla), Vaishnavi Murthy (Anek Kannada), Omkar Bhoir (Anek Telugu), Mrunmayee Ghaisas (Anek Gujarati), Mahesh Sahu (Anek Odia), and Sarang Kulkarni (Anek Gurmukhi). Project management and design assistance by Noopur Datye, and Font engineering and design assistance by Girish Dalvi.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/EkType/Anek\n\nMultiple scripts for multilingual India\nlink\nThe award-winning Anek variable font\nlink\nThe nine scripts have base characters in the center, with vowel signs and conjuncts that come above, below or next to them.\n\nThe Anek multi-script typeface for 9 Indian languages and Latin was made through a collaboration of 12 type designers working across 8 cities in India.\n\nHow did Ek Type win two type design awards (the TDC Certificate of Typographic Excellence and the D&AD Graphite Pencil) for their Anek multi-script typeface?\n\nThere were two key factors to their success:\n\nTeamwork: The team of 12 collaborated democratically.\nEquality: Giving equal value to each of the nine Indian writing systems (scripts) and Latin, while maintaining both common visual features and script-specific characteristics.\nTeamwork during lockdown\nlink\n\nGetting 12 people to collaborate while speaking in three languages (English, Hindi, and Marathi) and spread out in eight different Indian cities (Mumbai, Pune, Kalyan, Hinganghat, Baroda, Bengaluru, Bharampur, and Pali) is not an easy task.\n\nEk Type established a collaboration structure that fostered teamwork, while also giving designers the liberty to be creative.\n\nThe team consisted of Maithili Shingre, Yesha Goshar, Kailash Malviya, Aadarsh Rajan, Sulekha Rajkumar, Vaishnavi Murthy, Omkar Bhoir, Mrunmayee Ghaisas, Mahesh Sahu, Sarang Kulkarni, Noopur Datye, and Girish Dalvi.\n\nTen people focused on one script each, while the other two members worked on font engineering and project management. The designers focused on the script that was most familiar to them.\n\nVia three- to four-hour weekly video calls, team members annotated drawings with emojis, arrows, text, and other marks in their video conference platform. In between calls, the team collaborated online. The team made design decisions based on majority or unanimous votes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, most of the team had worked together at the Ek Type studio in Mumbai. Remote work created some unforeseen benefits. “Everyone had the time to venture in different directions, not getting colored by what the others were doing,” said Noopur Datye, co-founder and type designer at Ek Type.\n\nTo learn more, read Multilingual scripts for multilingual India."

    "description": "Formal Scripts are great typefaces to suggest elegance, quality, refinement and luxury. They are used a lot in print publishing, but you don't see many formal scripts used on the web. Isn't it? Mostly because their tiny hairlines breaks and disappear when used at small sizes on the screen.\n\nAlso, they usually have long ascenders and descenders, and the lowercase letters look too small when compared to most sans or serif fonts. More over, they are usually quite condensed, making them even more difficult to read.\n\nThat's why we designed a script type specifically tailored for web use, that can survive being set even as small as 13px."

    "description": "Trirong means “tricolor flag” in Thai, and represents the flag of Thailand. A serif Latin and looped Thai typeface, it is characterized by thick and thin strokes, and its narrow and tall structure echoes that of traditional Thai typefaces. It saves space while preserving readability and legibility with its oval-shape looped terminal. This looped Thai and Transitional serif Latin works well in formal contexts.\n\nThe similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, and ฎ and ฏ is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. Trirong takes a specific approach in how it deals with the thick and thin strokes in Thai glyphs. Other type designers of Thai fonts may like to use this approach as a reference. Formal looped Thai typefaces have delicate details, so it is important for type designers to take care when extending them into heavy weights and avoid obscuring important details. The sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully too, because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.\n\nThe Trirong project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand.

The distinct and sharp, quirky and attention seeking details inspired Minjoo Ham to use it for a rather uncommon revival project and turn it into a robust, contemporary typeface. Once the Hangeul was finished, Mark Frömberg took on the challenge to translate the characteristics to the Latin design. A lively exploration into the possible and impossible began. Hahmlet is great for any kind of typesetting, print or screen but also a perfect eyecatcher for signage and poster designs. We highly recommend to use it for Hangeul and Latin bilingual typography.\n\nTo contribute to the project, visit https://github.com/hyper-type/hahmlet/"

    "description": "David Libre is a Libre David Hebrew, based on David Hadash Formal, released by Monotype Corporation in 2012. David Hadash Formal is a modern digitization made from original large scale technical drawings for the typeface drawn by Ismar David.\n\nGoogle has worked with Monotype to release the 3 book weights (Regular, Medium and Bold) under the SIL Open Font License and create a new version for use by the public.\n\nThis project includes working with the David Hadash sources to create a new version, that fits the requirements of Israeli instituions, since David is the official font for Israeli correspondence.\n\nSome glyphs were updated, such as the Sheqel symbol. It was redesigned to be recognizable by contemporary Hebrew readers, since the original Sheqel symbol is too far from today's standard.\n\nLatin characters from the Gentium typeface were derived and integrated to accommodate cases in which Latin and Hebrew characters will be used in tandem.\n\nEach font includes OpenType features required for diacritic marks (nikud) and Hebrew-specific uses, including alternative Hebrew-height numerals (available as Stylistic Set 1) an alternative \"Hebrew ampersand\" symbol designed by Ismar David (available in Stylistic Set 2) and an alternative Sheqel symbol designed by Ismar David (available in Stylistic Set 3.)\n\nEvery effort was made to keep the original designs intact, and the type's original spacing is well preserved. However, several changes have been made to fit with David Libre's goal to be used as a free alternative to the David font commonly installed on PCs. In order to be compatible with documents previously set in the version of David bundled with Microsoft Windows, David Hadash's glyph size has been reduced by 12.5%. This was made to prevent cases in which documents previously typed in Microsoft's David to take up more pages and cause odd line breaks. Please note that this does not guarantee full compatibility with that David, only a close approximation.\n\nDiacritic marks have been repositioned. Biblical cantillation marks are not supported.\n\nThe construction of David Libre was made by Meir Sadan, commissioned by Google for the Google Fonts project.\n\nThe David Libre project is led by Meir Sadan, a type designer based in Tel Aviv, Israel.

It is characterized by expressive, flowing, and bulging curves, mannered awkwardness, and the bobbles on the terminals of its characters. The ‘modern face’ type genre is the typographical equivalent, and it can be found in books printed throughout the nineteenth century. This genre survived in educational textbooks produced throughout the twentieth century, and is preserved in computer science as the style which Donald Knuth adopted for his TEX typesetting system.\n\nBentham is a half-way design; true neither to the type produced during the nineteenth century, nor to the letterforms of cartographers, stonecutters, or engravers. Really it is an examination of the characteristics that these letters share, colored by Ben's approach to type drawing."

The idea was to design an average font for use in text, through a lengthy process of shape measurement and data gathering in spreadsheets. This resulted in a series of parameters which could be used by a designer to determine the proportions, color, spacing and other attributes of a typeface. Once the parameters were defined and best values were selected, the forms for the Average Regular typeface were drawn.\n\nIn september 2022, Average has been updated to provide a larger glyphset and therefore greater language support.\n\nA sans sister family, Average Sans, is also available.\n\nTo contribute to the project contact\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/etunni/average."

While the glyph design of Peter Wiegel’s font has hardly been changed at all, UnifrakturMaguntia uses smart font technologies for displaying the font’s ligatures (OpenType, Apple Advanced Typography and SIL Graphite). An experimental feature is the distinction of good blackletter typography between required ligatures ‹ch, ck, ſt, tz› that must be kept when letterspacing is increased, and regular ligatures (for instance, ‹fi, fl›) that are broken up when letterspacing is increased.\n\nUnifrakturMaguntia is optimized for @font-face linking on the internet by combining standards compliance with a permissive license.\n\nUnifrakturMaguntia has first been published in 2010 at UnifrakturMaguntia. It has been edited with FontForge, the libre outline font editor. OpenType features have been added with FontForge directly. AAT features have been added with ftxenhancer of the Apple Font Tools. Graphite has been added with the Graphite Compiler. For more information about AAT and Graphite, you may want to check out the Free Tengwar Font Project: Adding Graphite and AAT to a font."

    "description": "Kadwa is a Devanagari typeface family designed by Sol Matas. It is based on the original Latin typeface Bitter, a slab serif typeface for text.\n\nPeople read and interact with text on screens more and more each day. What happens on screen ends up being more important than what comes out of the printer. With the accelerating popularity of electronic books, type designers are working hard to seek out the ideal designs for reading on screen.\n\nMotivated by Sol's love for the pixel she designed Bitter, and later Kadwa. A \"contemporary\" slab serif typeface for text, it is specially designed for comfortably reading on any computer or device. The robust design started from the austerity of the pixel grid, based on rational rather than emotional principles. It combines the large x-heights and legibility of the humanistic tradition with subtle characteristics in the characters that inject a certain rhythm to flowing texts.\n\nIt has little variation in stroke weight and the Regular is darker than a typical typeface intended for use in print. This generates an intense color in paragraphs, accentuated by the serifs that are as thick as strokes, with square terminals.\n\nEach glyph is carefully designed with an excellent curve quality added to the first stage of the design, that was entirely made in a pixel grid. The typeface is balanced and manually spaced to use very few kerning pairs, especially important for web font use since most browsers do not currently support this feature.\n\nThe Kadwa project is led by Sol Matas, a type designer based in Berlin, Germany.

Madimi takes inspiration from the gentle curved geometry of certain Southern Afrikan graphic symbols.

    "description": "B612 is an highly legible open source font family, designed and tested to be used on aircraft cockpit screens. Its design makes it particularly suitable for degraded contexts (ensuring legibility and readability of data), with a positive effect on reducing visual fatigue and cognitive load. Particular attention was given to the uniformity of the typeface, whether being used for isolated terms, reading information on a map, mixing capital letters and numbers, waypoint lists, long or abbreviated texts, specific terms and data in the aeronautical field.\n\nIn 2010, Airbus initiated a research collaboration with ENAC and Université de Toulouse III on a prospective study to define and validate an “Aeronautical Font”: the challenge was to improve the display of textual data information on all cockpit screens, concerning more specifically legibility, readability and reading comfort, and to enhance the overall cockpit consistency. The typographical research was conducted through iterations from experimentation to design. Two years later, Airbus came to Intactile DESIGN in order to design and develop the eight variants of the font. Baptized B612 in reference to the imaginary asteroid of the aviator Antoine de Saint‑Exupéry, the font has been optimised following a calligraphic approach, in order to preserve the readable qualities of humanist typefaces like réales and incises, but also the technical and functional image of sans serif or bitmap.\n\nB612 is a two-weight font family including roman and italic styles but also a monospaced variation, B612 Mono. It was designed in 2012 by Nicolas Chauveau, Thomas Paillot and Jonathan Favre-Lamarine from the design agency Intactile DESIGN, and Jean-Luc Vinot from ENAC (French National University of Civil Aviation) Interactive Informatics Team for Laurent Spaggiari from the Airbus Human Factors department — prior research by Jean‑Luc Vinot (DGAC/DSNA) and Sylvie Athènes (Université de Toulouse III). In 2017, Airbus agreed to publish the font with an open source license (Eclipse Public License) within the Polarsys project, an industry-oriented project hosted by the Eclipse foundation. B612 project was awarded the Observeur du Design: Industry Star in 2018.\n\nUpdated 2019-03: Updated to latest upstream release.\n\nThe B612 project is led by Polarsys, an Eclipse Working Group created by large industry players and by tools providers to collaborate on the creation and support of Open Source tools for the development of embedded systems.

Radley is a practical face, based on letterforms used by hand carvers who cut letters quickly, efficiently, and with style. It can be used for both titling and text typography.\n\nThe basic letterforms in Radley grew out of sketching and designing directly into wood with traditional carving chisels. These were scanned and traced into FontForge and cleaned up digitally, then the character set was expanded. There is something unique about carving letters into wood with traditional hand tools, and hopefully Radley carries some of the original spirit of these hand carved letterforms.\n\nSince the initial launch in 2012, Radley was updated by Vernon Adams adding an Italic and support for more Latin languages. He made many glyph refinements throughout the family based on user feedback. In 2017 the family was updated by Marc Foley to complete the work started by Vernon.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/RadleyFont"

Plex is an international typeface family designed to capture IBM’s brand spirit and history and to illustrate the unique relationship between mankind and machine—a principal theme for IBM since the turn of the century. The result is a neutral yet friendly Grotesque style typeface that balances design with the engineered details that make Plex distinctly IBM. The family includes a Sans, Sans Condensed, Mono, and Serif and has excellent legibility in print, web, and mobile interfaces.\n\nPlex’s three designs work well independently and even better together. Use the Sans as a contemporary compadre, the Serif for editorial storytelling, or the Mono to show code snippets. The unexpectedly expressive nature of the italics gives you even more options for your designs. Currently, IBM Plex Sans supports Extended Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean and Thai."

It means that the space are modular, 250, 500, 750, this allow a better spacing between characters, but allow also a vertical alignment similar to the one possible with a monospaced font. We were thinking it was a bright new idea, but we discovered that was usual for Olivetti typewriters working with 'Margherita.'\n\nFind out more at lektongroups.blogspot.co.uk.\n\nUpdated in November 2012: As one of the earlier families published in Google Web Fonts, Lekton lacked proper subsetting, so this update introduces a default 'latin' subset that contains less characters but loads faster. To use the full character set, update your API link to include the latin-ext subset."

Available in nine Indian scripts plus Arabic along with a Latin counterpart, the family is Unicode compliant and libre licensed.\n\nBaloo 2 is an extension of the earlier Baloo project. The new Baloo 2 includes additional glyphs, engineering improvements, and has been extended to five weights, ranging from the light footed Regular to the affable ExtraBold. The lighter weights retain Baloo’s characteristic bounce, but they do so slightly, infusing life into each word. This allows the new family to freely fraternise with texts of all sizes and temperaments — be it short bursts or copious reams, demanding headlines or whispering bylines. Carefree yet confident, sprightly yet versatile, the renewed family of Baloo promises to bring warmth to every project.\n\nThe Baloo 2 project consists of ten font families with unique local names for each of the nine Indic scripts plus Arabic (Baloo Bhaijaan 2). Each family supports one Indic/Arabic script plus Latin, Latin Extended, and Vietnamese.\n\nIt took a team of committed type designers to rear Baloo and raise it to be the typeface we love. The Gurmukhi is designed by Shuchita Grover; Bangla by Noopur Datye and Sulekha Rajkumar; Odia by Yesha Goshar, Manish Minz, and Shuchita Grover; Gujarati by Noopur Datye and Supriya Tembe; Kannada by Divya Kowshik and Shuchita Grover; Telugu by Maithili Shingre and Omkar Shende; Malayalam by Maithili Shingre and Unnati Kotecha; and Tamil by Aadarsh Rajan. Baloo Devanagari and Latin are collaboratively designed by Ek Type. Font engineering and type design assistance by Girish Dalvi.\n\nTo contribute to the project, visit github.com/EkType/Baloo2"

    "description": "Tilt is a family of type inspired by the dimensional lettering found in storefront signage. It’s comprised of three related variable font styles that you might find in a shop window — Tilt Neon, Tilt Prism, and Tilt Warp.\n\nAll three are based around the same letter model of a sign painter’s geometric sans serif, similar to the typefaces Futura or Avant Garde, but with the kinds of details you might expect to see when the letter is built up with a brush.\n\nThe three styles are designed and built as variable fonts. They allow users to rotate the orientation of their glyphs with “Rotation in X” and “Rotation in Y” axes. The rotation is limited to ±45° so that the letterforms never rotate past a readable range.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/Tilt-Fonts.\n\nThe most common axes used in variable fonts are Italic, Optical Size, Slant, Weight, and Width. And while you can sometimes get creative at the extremes of these axes, they're more often used to finesse type. For example, with Weight, you don't have to settle on what the type designer designated as the Bold style, you can tweak it to be a bit lighter or heavier so it's perfect for you.\n\nVariable fonts also open up many possibilities for creative expression! And Google Fonts is adding a bunch of fonts to your palette with new axes to get your juices flowing.\n\nFirst up are the Tilt fonts by Andy Clymer, Tilt Neon, Tilt Prism, and Tilt Warp:\nlink\n\nInitially sparked by the experience of seeing a neon sign from the side, Clymer was inspired to create fonts that allow the orientation of their glyphs to be rotated horizontally and vertically. \"With variable fonts, I thought it was kind of amazing how the physical form of a common sans-serif could inadvertently blend into something that looked like graffiti lettering,\" says Clymer.\n\nAll three fonts are takes on dimensional storefront signage and are controlled by Rotation in X (HROT), and Rotation in Y (VROT) variable axes. The rotation is limited to ±45° so that the letterforms are always within a readable range.\n\nTo learn more, visit:\n\nGet ready for a windfall of new axes, starting with Tilt Neon, Tilt Prism, and Tilt Warp\nTilt minisite"

Approaching the idea of web-publishing as a modern day private press, it is designed to evoke Venetian incunabula and humanist manuscripts, but with the quirks and idiosyncrasies of the kinds of typefaces you find in this artisanal tradition.\n\nIt comes with a complement of typographical sorts and OpenType features for the purpose. The proportions of Inknut Antiqua make it well suited for low-resolution screens.\n\nThe Inknut (Terminalia Chebula), called »harad« in Hindi, is a nut-like fruit that can be used for ink making and is purported to cure blindness. The tree it grows from is native to the Indian sub-continent and south-east Asia.\n\nThe Inknut Antiqua project is led by Claus Eggers Sørensen, a type designer based in Amsterdam.

    "description": "The Charles Bluemlein Script Collection is an intriguing reminder of the heady days of hand lettering and calligraphy in the United States. From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs.\n\nAlejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein."

However in small sizes these gestures become less noticeable, making it possible to set longer texts. The name means somersault in Latin. The a, e and G are the real acrobats, and the \"g\" makes a double salto! Capriola was spaced for use on the web.

Used for the Georgian language of Georgia, and other Kartvelian languages. Since 430 CE, the Georgian language used an inscriptional form (Asomtavruli), which evolved into a manuscript form (Nuskhuri). These are categorized as Khutsuri (ecclesiastical): Asomtavruli is uppercase, Nuskhuri is lowercase. Khutsuri is still used for liturgical purposes, but was replaced by a new case-less form (Mkhedruli) used for nearly all modern Georgian writing. In the 1950s, Akaki Shanidze attempted to add Asomtavruli as uppercase and use Mkhedruli for lowercase, but the effort did not succeed.

    "description": "A perfect blend of pointy paws in a coat of fur, Baloo is an affable display typeface by Ek Type. Available in nine Indian scripts plus Arabic along with a Latin counterpart, the family is Unicode compliant and libre licensed.\n\nBaloo 2 is an extension of the earlier Baloo project. The new Baloo 2 includes additional glyphs, engineering improvements, and has been extended to five weights, ranging from the light footed Regular to the affable ExtraBold. The lighter weights retain Baloo’s characteristic bounce, but they do so slightly, infusing life into each word. This allows the new family to freely fraternise with texts of all sizes and temperaments — be it short bursts or copious reams, demanding headlines or whispering bylines. Carefree yet confident, sprightly yet versatile, the renewed family of Baloo promises to bring warmth to every project.\n\nThe Baloo 2 project consists of ten font families with unique local names for each of the nine Indic scripts plus Arabic (Baloo Bhaijaan 2). Each family supports one Indic/Arabic script plus Latin, Latin Extended, and Vietnamese.\n\nIt took a team of committed type designers to rear Baloo and raise it to be the typeface we love. The Gurmukhi is designed by Shuchita Grover; Bangla by Noopur Datye and Sulekha Rajkumar; Odia by Yesha Goshar, Manish Minz, and Shuchita Grover; Gujarati by Noopur Datye and Supriya Tembe; Kannada by Divya Kowshik and Shuchita Grover; Telugu by Maithili Shingre and Omkar Shende; Malayalam by Maithili Shingre and Unnati Kotecha; and Tamil by Aadarsh Rajan. Baloo Devanagari and Latin are collaboratively designed by Ek Type. Font engineering and type design assistance by Girish Dalvi.\n\nTo contribute to the project, visit github.com/EkType/Baloo2"

    "description": "The Charles Bluemlein Script Collection is an intriguing reminder of the heady days of hand lettering and calligraphy in the United States. From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs.\n\nAlejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein."

Each also has slight stress derived from handwriting. Antic Didone's minuscule ornate serifs create a unique texture. With modern proportions and condensed letterforms, it is great for economical typesetting, on paper and on screen.\n\nThe Antic Type System is in progress and is being regularly improved.

The design follows manuscript traditions of letterform construction, and was inspired by the proportions and overall texture of handset metal type used by leading Kolkata publishing houses in pre-mechanical typography. For the Open Font License release, Tiro Bangla has been extended to support additional characters, and features a new italic companion. Each font also includes a Latin subset including diacritics for transcription of Indian languages.\n\nTiro Bangla was designed by John Hudson and Fiona Ross. The italic was adapted by Neelakash Kshetrimayum.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TiroTypeworks/Indigo.\n\nModern Tiro Indic collection for classical South Asian texts\nlink\nThe beauty and challenges of bridging the old and the new\nlink\n\nTwo type designers separated by an eight-hour time difference, an ocean, and pandemic travel bans collaborated over video calls and email to make a cohesive set of fonts in 8 South Asian languages. In 2012, Harvard University Press commissioned Fiona Ross and John Hudson, through Tiro Typeworks, to design typefaces for the Murty Classical Library of India book series. The publisher needed to reprint ancient Indian literary, historical, and religious texts, including Vedic and early Sanskrit works. Since these old texts had been printed using traditional letterforms and early Indian typography techniques, the new fonts needed to retain some of the traditional style of the old texts, yet be clear and legible in modern print and digital media.\n\nIn 2019 Google Fonts approached Tiro to make an extended and updated version of the Murty Fonts to be released as open source fonts in the Tiro Indic collection, offering users traditional text styles suitable for a variety of uses.\n\nStudy the classics and language structure\nlink\n\nBefore designing the typefaces, it was important to research classical texts and understand the unique characteristics of the languages.\n\n“We looked at very lovely manuscripts or early Indian printed materials from the 18th or 19th Centuries,” said John Hudson.\n\nTo learn more, read Modern Tiro Indic collection for classical South Asian texts."

    "description": "B612 is an highly legible open source font family, designed and tested to be used on aircraft cockpit screens. Its design makes it particularly suitable for degraded contexts (ensuring legibility and readability of data), with a positive effect on reducing visual fatigue and cognitive load. Particular attention was given to the uniformity of the typeface, whether being used for isolated terms, reading information on a map, mixing capital letters and numbers, waypoint lists, long or abbreviated texts, specific terms and data in the aeronautical field.\n\nIn 2010, Airbus initiated a research collaboration with ENAC and Université de Toulouse III on a prospective study to define and validate an “Aeronautical Font”: the challenge was to improve the display of textual data information on all cockpit screens, concerning more specifically legibility, readability and reading comfort, and to enhance the overall cockpit consistency. The typographical research was conducted through iterations from experimentation to design. Two years later, Airbus came to Intactile DESIGN in order to design and develop the eight variants of the font. Baptized B612 in reference to the imaginary asteroid of the aviator Antoine de Saint‑Exupéry, the font has been optimised following a calligraphic approach, in order to preserve the readable qualities of humanist typefaces like réales and incises, but also the technical and functional image of sans serif or bitmap.\n\nB612 is a two-weight font family including roman and italic styles but also a monospaced variation, B612 Mono. It was designed in 2012 by Nicolas Chauveau, Thomas Paillot and Jonathan Favre-Lamarine from the design agency Intactile DESIGN, and Jean-Luc Vinot from ENAC (French National University of Civil Aviation) Interactive Informatics Team for Laurent Spaggiari from the Airbus Human Factors department — prior research by Jean‑Luc Vinot (DGAC/DSNA) and Sylvie Athènes (Université de Toulouse III). In 2017, Airbus agreed to publish the font with an open source license (Eclipse Public License) within the Polarsys project, an industry-oriented project hosted by the Eclipse foundation. B612 project was awarded the Observeur du Design: Industry Star in 2018.\n\nUpdated 2019-03: Updated to latest upstream release.\n\nThe B612 project is led by Polarsys, an Eclipse Working Group created by large industry players and by tools providers to collaborate on the creation and support of Open Source tools for the development of embedded systems.

Initially the font contained only capitals and digits and existed only on paper and stone inscriptions. In 2010 I decided transfer this font to a computer, and made the missing lowercase and some basical signs; it was initially named Gothica.\n\nBy the way I made other versions of some letters. It was a lot of this at the end of my work. I decided create new fonts based on these letters. And finally I created six fonts family and named these fonts Nova (NovaCut, NovaFlat, NovaOval, NovaRound, NovaSlim, NovaSquare - by the shape of individual fonts). At last I created monospace font - NovaMono - the seventh part of this family."

All these inspirations from sources in different periods in history of the Arabic and Latin world cumulate in a contemporary, legible and aesthetically rich design for use across different media.\n\nKufam Arabic is designed by Wael Morcos and Kufam Latin by Artur Schmal and originally conceived within the framework of The Khatt Foundations’ Typographic Matchmaking in the City project.\n\nTo contribute or to read more about the design and history of Kufam, see github.com/originaltype/kufam."

An adult re-reads a news article and still doesn’t understand what it’s about. Both readers end up frustrated and feeling like there is something wrong with them. Thankfully there might be a simple answer. Dr. Bonnie Shaver-Troup thinks fonts are part of the problem and the solution to many reading problems.\n\n“We have a global reading crisis and we can change much of it by delivering fonts that are optimized for the visual field and for the individual. The answer is hidden in plain sight. It’s the font,” said Shaver-Troup.\n\nChange the font, change the outcome\nlink\n\nWhile working as an educational therapist in Silicon Valley, Shaver-Troup helped students with dyslexia and other reading problems to learn to read. She experimented by changing the spacing between certain letters in their reading assignments, and found that it improved their reading and comprehension. According to Shaver-Troup, the issue wasn’t in her students’ minds, it was with the letterforms they saw on the screen or paper.\n\n“The majority of the reading problems, including dyslexia, are not cognitive or phonological. They are visual or perceptual. Our testing has a built-in design flaw. We use fonts to deliver text for reading that are too tight for efficient or successful visual processing. Then we get poor results, suggesting the reading issue is phonological or cognitive. If we change the font to the tested optimized font fit, then we change the outcome,” she explained.\n\nTo learn more, read:\nClean and clear: making reading easier with Lexend (English)\nPartnering to change how the world reads (English)\nEine Partnerschaft mit dem Ziel, das Leseerlebnis weltweit zu verändern: Erweiterung von Lexend um verschiedene Schriftstärken (German)"

    "description": "Rotund curves, large loops and voluminous counters. Gotu reimagines Devanagari calligraphy while at the same time reinterprets what high contrast Latin typefaces can be. Though the Devanagari is penned with a traditional canted nib, the structures are improvised with an expressive whim that belies conventions of structure and challenges notions of consistency. Swooping calligraphic strokes inspire forms that are lyrical without being too opulent. The same spirit resonates within a modulated sans serif style Latin as letters retain a calligraphic stress and keep the delicate typographic quirks. Furnished with such typographic subtleties, Gotu can lend its distinct style to a quaint monograph, a striking headline, an ornate invite or even a chic brand.\n\nThis project is led by Ek Type, a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces.

He is currently in his third year, three years before his exam. He hopes to continue his practices in the fields of type and graphic design after he finishes school and release many more typefaces in the future.\n\nHis love for the tiny details, balance in proportions and urge for perfection made him into what he is today.

Available in nine Indian scripts plus Arabic along with a Latin counterpart, the family is Unicode compliant and libre licensed.\n\nBaloo 2 is an extension of the earlier Baloo project. The new Baloo 2 includes additional glyphs, engineering improvements, and has been extended to five weights, ranging from the light footed Regular to the affable ExtraBold. The lighter weights retain Baloo’s characteristic bounce, but they do so slightly, infusing life into each word. This allows the new family to freely fraternise with texts of all sizes and temperaments — be it short bursts or copious reams, demanding headlines or whispering bylines. Carefree yet confident, sprightly yet versatile, the renewed family of Baloo promises to bring warmth to every project.\n\nThe Baloo 2 project consists of ten font families with unique local names for each of the nine Indic scripts plus Arabic (Baloo Bhaijaan 2). Each family supports one Indic/Arabic script plus Latin, Latin Extended, and Vietnamese.\n\nIt took a team of committed type designers to rear Baloo and raise it to be the typeface we love. The Gurmukhi is designed by Shuchita Grover; Bangla by Noopur Datye and Sulekha Rajkumar; Odia by Yesha Goshar, Manish Minz, and Shuchita Grover; Gujarati by Noopur Datye and Supriya Tembe; Kannada by Divya Kowshik and Shuchita Grover; Telugu by Maithili Shingre and Omkar Shende; Malayalam by Maithili Shingre and Unnati Kotecha; and Tamil by Aadarsh Rajan. Baloo Devanagari and Latin are collaboratively designed by Ek Type. Font engineering and type design assistance by Girish Dalvi.\n\nTo contribute to the project, visit github.com/EkType/Baloo2"

Following their lead, Bungee typesets horizontally and vertically, so it is always ready to take your text in a new direction.\n\nBungee’s letterforms were designed to reinforce a sense of verticality. Round characters like O and diagonal characters like A are straight-sided, and letters like L and I gain serifs in order to create vertical words with well-defined left and right edges.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/djrrb/Bungee\n\nThe Bungee family\nlink\n\nGoogle Fonts distributes seven variants of Bungee, including two color fonts:\n\nBungee\nBungee Hairline\nBungee Inline\nBungee Outline\nBungee Shade\nBungee Tint, a COLRv0 font\nBungee Spice, a COLRv1 font\n\nBungee’s downloadable releases also includes special layer fonts (for multicolor typesetting in environments where color fonts are not supported) and rotated fonts (for stacked typesetting in environments where vertical text is not supported).\n\nThe Bungee project is led by David Jonathan Ross, and thanks to support from Google and The Font Bureau, Bungee was released under the SIL Open Font License.\n\nIn 2023–24, Marte Verhaegen and Just van Rossum produced a major revision (v2), which includes an automated build process as well as many enhancements to the vertical features and color fonts."

The project currently comprises a total of 45 font files spanning 9 different visual styles (Roman, Italic, Infant, Infant Italic, Garamond, Garamond Italic, Upright Cursive, Small Caps, and Unicase) and 5 weights (Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold.) Cormorant was conceived, drawn, spaced, kerned, programmed, interpolated, and produced in its entirety by Christian Thalmann of Catharsis Fonts. For an illustrated presentation and description of the family, please visit its Bēhance page.\n\nWhile this project was heavily inspired by Claude Garamont's immortal legacy, Christian did not use any specific font as a starting point or direct reference for the designs. Most glyphs were drawn from scratch; when he needed guidance on a specific character, he searched for the term Garamond and skimmed through the results for a general impression.\n\nHe is grateful to the creative souls on the Typophile, TypeDrawers and Typografie forums, and Github, for a wealth of knowledge about type design, and for providing a large amount of excellent feedback on Cormorant during its development. He also thanks the tireless folks at Glyphs, in particular Rainer Erich Scheichelbauer of Schriftlabor and Georg Seifert. Special thanks go to Dave Crossland and Google Fonts for making the libre release of this font family possible through generous funding of the development process.\n\nThe Cormorant project is led by Christian Thalmann, a type designer based in Zurich, Switzerland.

    "description": "STANLEY MORISON, in his “THE ROMAN ITALIC & BLACK LETTER bequeathed to the University of Oxford by Dr. JOHN FELL” (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1951), began this way the description of the FELL TYPES: \"The Oxford Printing house holds the oldest punches and matrices surviving in England, material not only treasured but used; types cast therefrom being employed for the composition of books and other printed matter.\"\n\nIt’s essentially the inheritance of the will of John Fell, D.D. who died on 10 July 1686, aged 61, Bishop of Oxford and Dean of Christ Church. Since 1668 he spent his life creating a ‘learned press’ in Oxford, endowed with invaluable equipment, setting a high standard for the future of his publishing.\n\nHe wrote: \"The foundation of all successe must be layd in doing things well, and I am sure that will not be don with English letters\" (to Jenkins, 2 Dec. 1672). So he collectected types available in the foreign market: mainly France, Holland and Germany. Fell decided to develop types in its own ‘workhouse’ too.\n\nPeter De Walpergen became his personal type-founder. Says Harry Carter in “THE FELL TYPES. What has been done in and about them” (Oxford University Press, New York, 1968): \"He was born at Frankfurt am Main, descended from a Protestant refugee from Antwerp. He was engaged by the Dutch East India Company in 1671 to work as a type-founder and printer in Java. The comparative crudity of his letter design makes it seems unlikely that he had been trained to cut punches.\"\n\nJohn Fell entrusted him with the cut of the larger bodies: Great Primer Roman and Italic; Double Pica Roman and Italic; French Canon Roman and Italic; Three Lines Pica Roman. De Walpergen cut other types and letters for existing types to be harmonized with the larger bodies. Commented Morison: \"The design of these large Fell Types is difficult to characterize and impossible wholly to approve. It has some affinity with the Dutch work of the second half of the seventeenth century, especially with the bigger size of type shown in the Widow Elsevier’s specimen-sheet of types attributed to Christoffel van Dyck; but De Walpergen went much further in the contrasting weight of thick and thin strokes and his design has crudities about it of which Van Dyck would not have been capable.\"\n\nIn 1686 John Fell died. In his “will” he bequeathed the entire collection of type to the University of Oxford. Remembers Morison: \"This entire collection of ‘founding Materialls of Punchions Matrices Moulds’ was ‘got together’ by John Fell ‘and others at great expense’. Fell’s instructions that they ‘be carefully kept together’ by his executors were duly observed. The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford honourably played their part in sustaining the interests of ‘learning and printing’ and thus the collection was not dissipated but manteined entire.\""

Available in nine Indian scripts plus Arabic along with a Latin counterpart, the family is Unicode compliant and libre licensed.\n\nBaloo 2 is an extension of the earlier Baloo project. The new Baloo 2 includes additional glyphs, engineering improvements, and has been extended to five weights, ranging from the light footed Regular to the affable ExtraBold. The lighter weights retain Baloo’s characteristic bounce, but they do so slightly, infusing life into each word. This allows the new family to freely fraternise with texts of all sizes and temperaments — be it short bursts or copious reams, demanding headlines or whispering bylines. Carefree yet confident, sprightly yet versatile, the renewed family of Baloo promises to bring warmth to every project.\n\nThe Baloo 2 project consists of ten font families with unique local names for each of the nine Indic scripts plus Arabic (Baloo Bhaijaan 2). Each family supports one Indic/Arabic script plus Latin, Latin Extended, and Vietnamese.\n\nIt took a team of committed type designers to rear Baloo and raise it to be the typeface we love. The Gurmukhi is designed by Shuchita Grover; Bangla by Noopur Datye and Sulekha Rajkumar; Odia by Yesha Goshar, Manish Minz, and Shuchita Grover; Gujarati by Noopur Datye and Supriya Tembe; Kannada by Divya Kowshik and Shuchita Grover; Telugu by Maithili Shingre and Omkar Shende; Malayalam by Maithili Shingre and Unnati Kotecha; and Tamil by Aadarsh Rajan. Baloo Devanagari and Latin are collaboratively designed by Ek Type. Font engineering and type design assistance by Girish Dalvi.\n\nTo contribute to the project, visit github.com/EkType/Baloo2"

It offers personality, readability and economy.\n\nOne of the most important features of Esteban is its stroke, that loses or gains weight in the stems. This feature was defined from the manuscripts of Jorge Alfredo Díaz Esteban, a writer who used a tool that can generate modulated strokes. This means the stroke width varies due to the pressure of the pen on the paper, and this quality allows the font to have a presence on the page that makes texts more dynamic. The precise level of contrast was decided by experimenting with various 'colors' of density that emerge in text settings. This allows Esteban to achieve good performance even in medium and low quality prints and as a web font."

It combines high quality in readability and legibility while carrying on the stately Japanese Mincho type tradition. BIZ UD Mincho bases its design on one of the typefaces from the Morisawa font library, which has thicker horizontal lines than the traditional Mincho type style. Because most Mincho types have thin horizontal strokes, the style can be difficult to read on some displays or signs and for people with low vision. For the universal design version, dakuten (゛) and handakuten (゜) voicing marks are designed to be more legible, and the letterforms are adjusted to maintain their balance while having a larger face and wider counters.\n\nUDMincho includes full-width kana. UDPMincho includes proportional-width kana.\n\nTo contribute to the project, visit github.com/googlefonts/morisawa-biz-ud-mincho\n\nMorisawa BIZ Universal Design (UD) Japanese fonts added to Google Fonts and Google Workspace\nlink\n\nAs part of our larger effort to make great type accessible in more languages, Google Fonts is pleased to announce that the Japanese type foundry Morisawa has made 2 BIZ Universal Design (UD) font families available on Google Fonts, under the SIL Open Font License. These Gothic and Mincho designs, available in regular and bold weights and proportional and full width styles, are now also available in Google Workspace.\n\n“Having these fonts available in Japan allows Google Education to align with the most widely used fonts in education publishing in Japan,” said Stuart Miller, Head of Marketing for Google Education in Asia Pacific (APAC). “This makes it easier for partners to collaborate with Google Education. It also ensures a more consistent, inclusive, delightful experience for the millions of teachers and students that use Google tools.”\n\nDrawing on extensive end-user evaluation, the BIZ UD typefaces were developed using the principles of universal design (UD) to ensure legibility (the ease of differentiating individual characters) and readability (the ease of reading text overall). BIZ UD fonts are especially suited for conveying text accurately—for example, in educational settings, corporate communication environments, and other places that use ICT.\n\nTo learn more, read Morisawa BIZ Universal Design (UD) Japanese fonts added to Google Fonts and Google Workspace."

In 2010 I decided transfer this font to a computer, and made the missing lowercase and some basical signs; it was initially named Gothica.\n\nBy the way I made other versions of some letters. It was a lot of this at the end of my work. I decided create new fonts based on these letters. And finally I created six fonts family and named these fonts Nova (NovaCut, NovaFlat, NovaOval, NovaRound, NovaSlim, NovaSquare - by the shape of individual fonts). At last I created monospace font - NovaMono - the seventh part of this family."

    "description": "Tilt is a family of type inspired by the dimensional lettering found in storefront signage. It’s comprised of three related variable font styles that you might find in a shop window — Tilt Neon, Tilt Prism, and Tilt Warp.\n\nAll three are based around the same letter model of a sign painter’s geometric sans serif, similar to the typefaces Futura or Avant Garde, but with the kinds of details you might expect to see when the letter is built up with a brush.\n\nThe three styles are designed and built as variable fonts. They allow users to rotate the orientation of their glyphs with “Rotation in X” and “Rotation in Y” axes. The rotation is limited to ±45° so that the letterforms never rotate past a readable range.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/Tilt-Fonts.\n\nThe most common axes used in variable fonts are Italic, Optical Size, Slant, Weight, and Width. And while you can sometimes get creative at the extremes of these axes, they're more often used to finesse type. For example, with Weight, you don't have to settle on what the type designer designated as the Bold style, you can tweak it to be a bit lighter or heavier so it's perfect for you.\n\nVariable fonts also open up many possibilities for creative expression! And Google Fonts is adding a bunch of fonts to your palette with new axes to get your juices flowing.\n\nFirst up are the Tilt fonts by Andy Clymer, Tilt Neon, Tilt Prism, and Tilt Warp:\nlink\n\nInitially sparked by the experience of seeing a neon sign from the side, Clymer was inspired to create fonts that allow the orientation of their glyphs to be rotated horizontally and vertically. \"With variable fonts, I thought it was kind of amazing how the physical form of a common sans-serif could inadvertently blend into something that looked like graffiti lettering,\" says Clymer.\n\nAll three fonts are takes on dimensional storefront signage and are controlled by Rotation in X (HROT), and Rotation in Y (VROT) variable axes. The rotation is limited to ±45° so that the letterforms are always within a readable range.\n\nTo learn more, visit:\n\nGet ready for a windfall of new axes, starting with Tilt Neon, Tilt Prism, and Tilt Warp\nTilt minisite"

It has full support for the Arabic and Arabic Supplement Unicode blocks, and the Arabic Extended-A block with the exception of U+08D3..U+08E2.\n\nIn 2023 an additional two weights for this typeface family were added for a total of four weights now. The glyphset was expanded to support all of the Unicode 15.0 character set. Support for the Kyrgyz language was added.\n\nBob Hallissy does Graphite, OpenType, and TypeTuner code, and build support. Becca Hirsbrunner is the Lead Designer. George W. Nuss is the Original Designer. Iska Routamaa is a Contributing Designer. The Harmattan project is maintained by SIL International. Harmattan is released under the SIL Open Font License. Harmattan is a trademark of SIL International.\n\nFor further information about this font, including Unicode ranges supported, Graphite and OpenType font features and how to use them, and licensing, please see the documentation on the website software.sil.org/Harmattan.

The fonts were originally commissioned by Paula Scher at Pentagram, and designed by Jeremy Mickel at MCKL for a new Red Hat brand identity.\n\nThe Red Hat typefaces are a fresh take on the geometric sans genre, taking inspiration from a range of American sans serifs including Tempo and Highway Gothic. The Display styles are low contrast and spaced tightly, with a large x-height and open counters. The Text styles have a slightly smaller x-height and narrower width for better legibility, are spaced more generously, and have thinned joins for better performance at small sizes. The two families can be used together seamlessly at a range of sizes.\n\nThe November 2024 update addresses a frequently reported weight issue. The Medium and SemiBold weights now have slightly different weight compared to the previous version, ensuring better weight distribution within the design space and improved fluidity in the variable font.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/RedHatOfficial/RedHatFont"

The result is a neutral yet friendly Grotesque style typeface that balances design with the engineered details that make Plex distinctly IBM. The family includes a Sans, Sans Condensed, Mono, and Serif and has excellent legibility in print, web, and mobile interfaces.\n\nPlex’s three designs work well independently and even better together. Use the Sans as a contemporary compadre, the Serif for editorial storytelling, or the Mono to show code snippets. The unexpectedly expressive nature of the italics gives you even more options for your designs. Currently, IBM Plex Sans supports Extended Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean and Thai."

At that point Google Fonts had fewer than 10 Japanese families, most of which were basic Mincho (serif) and gothic (sans) designs. Since then the collection of Japanese fonts within the library has grown, now with 38 font families from 18 designers, in a variety of styles – from formal text types to fun display fonts. All these Japanese fonts are now live on Google Fonts for anyone to test out and use in any project.\n\nThe Zen Fonts collection is the largest set of Japanese fonts on Google Fonts\nlink\n\nAs part of this larger effort to expand Japanese offerings, Google Fonts collaborated with type designer Yoshimichi Ohira to open his prestigious collection of Zen Fonts typefaces to the public. With 23 Japanese and three Latin fonts in various styles of mincho (serif), gothic (sans serif), maru (rounded), and display styles, the Zen Fonts collection is now the largest set of Japanese fonts in Google Fonts’ expansive library, and is also available in Adobe Fonts.

    "description": "Sumana is a family of Latin and Devanagari fonts for text setting and web usage. Designed by Alexei Vanyashin in 2014-2015 for Cyreal.\n\nThe Latin counterpart is derived from Lora by Olga Karpushina, Cyreal. Its vertical and horizontal metrics are adjusted to better match with the Devanagari. The meaning of Sumana in Sanskrit is flower, which is the meaning of Lora in Spanish. It was quite a challenge to match the graphical characteristics of each script and took many iterations to finalise the first release. I tried to keep the Devanagari closer to a traditional Indian calligraphic model while flavouring it with graphic solutions derived from Lora's Latin.\n\nThanks to all the experts who consulted on this project, including Fiona Ross, Eric McLaughlin, Vaishnavi Murthy, Pria Ravichandran, and Wei Huang. The comments and revision history can be found in this discussion in the Google Fonts forum.\n\nTo contribute, visit github.com/cyrealtype/Sumana"

    "description": "Playpen Sans is one of the font families produced by TypeTogether during over two years of primary research into handwriting education for Latin-based languages, available at primarium.info.\n\nPlaypen Sans is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to ExtraBold (800), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages along with a set of \"reward icons\" as emoji.\n\nIt has seven alternate glyphs for each character that are automatically applied as you type, with a built-in shuffler that both ensures variation and avoids repetitive shapes in close proximity. This adds to the overall organic, spontaneous, and authentic feel of the handwritten style.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playpen-Sans\n\nA new casual handwriting font\nlink\n\nSome typefaces do more than one thing well, and others excel at one great thing. The Playpen Sans font family by Veronika Burian, Laura Meseguer, and José Scaglione excels at imitating casual handwriting with a completely natural look — the aesthetic form of something made by hand and the digital function of a professional typeface.\n\nThe font world has a general tension between what’s organic and what’s digital. When scribbling a quick note, the letters have slight differences, but all look similar because they come from the same person. Handwritten text is inconsistent, while digital typefaces are intended to be consistent — each character exactly the same every time it’s typed.\n\nThe goal of a typeface that is both casual in look and digital in nature is to appear authentically human within the bounds of digital reproduction. So, a typeface with a set of characters that are “the same but different” has the authenticity everyone craves. The main problem with casual fonts is not having enough alternate characters to look real. When a family has more than one alternate, another problem arises in controlling how and when a character gets replaced.\n\n\n\n\nTo solve these problems, Playpen Sans was designed with seven versions of each character, plus a built-in shuffler, so no single shape is repeated in close proximity. The result is text with spontaneous inconsistencies that feel fun and organic… all the benefits of a modern, professional typeface that looks natural.\n\nThe family was made for non-designers and it shines within short, informal settings: greeting cards and invitations, casual signs and documents, and of course, children’s books and educational materials, comic books, and graphic novels. Its straight and curved endings for ‘i, l, y’, the two-story ‘a’, and optional shapes for ‘f, G, I, M’ are clarifying features. It supports over 150 Latin-based languages, and it also comes in a variable font version for developers and designers who value ultimate control, data savings, and design superiority.\n\nPlaypen Sans is the combination of technological and aesthetic potential, showing the best of both worlds with its digital capabilities and casual, handmade look. Is it spontaneous? Is it authentic? Thankfully, yes, and yes.\n\n\n\nEmojis\nlink\n\nPlaypen Sans has emojis for breezy and encouraging uses, that each match the eight named weights of the Latin. Find here the list of all the emojis available. You can copy and paste them into your document editor when using the font. 😉\n\n🌠\n🎂\n🎯\n👆\n👍\n👎\n📖\n✍️\n🎨\n🏠\n✏\n✅\n❌\n🪫\n🏅\n📣\n🦄\n🦖\n🧩\n🪐\n✈︎\n🌞\n😍\n☠️\n☹️\n😉"

Since then the collection of Japanese fonts within the library has grown, now with 38 font families from 18 designers, in a variety of styles – from formal text types to fun display fonts. All these Japanese fonts are now live on Google Fonts for anyone to test out and use in any project.\n\nThe Zen Fonts collection is the largest set of Japanese fonts on Google Fonts\nlink\n\nAs part of this larger effort to expand Japanese offerings, Google Fonts collaborated with type designer Yoshimichi Ohira to open his prestigious collection of Zen Fonts typefaces to the public. With 23 Japanese and three Latin fonts in various styles of mincho (serif), gothic (sans serif), maru (rounded), and display styles, the Zen Fonts collection is now the largest set of Japanese fonts in Google Fonts’ expansive library, and is also available in Adobe Fonts.

    "description": "STANLEY MORISON, in his “THE ROMAN ITALIC & BLACK LETTER bequeathed to the University of Oxford by Dr. JOHN FELL” (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1951), began this way the description of the FELL TYPES: \"The Oxford Printing house holds the oldest punches and matrices surviving in England, material not only treasured but used; types cast therefrom being employed for the composition of books and other printed matter.\"\n\nIt’s essentially the inheritance of the will of John Fell, D.D. who died on 10 July 1686, aged 61, Bishop of Oxford and Dean of Christ Church. Since 1668 he spent his life creating a ‘learned press’ in Oxford, endowed with invaluable equipment, setting a high standard for the future of his publishing.\n\nHe wrote: \"The foundation of all successe must be layd in doing things well, and I am sure that will not be don with English letters\" (to Jenkins, 2 Dec. 1672). So he collectected types available in the foreign market: mainly France, Holland and Germany. Fell decided to develop types in its own ‘workhouse’ too.\n\nPeter De Walpergen became his personal type-founder. Says Harry Carter in “THE FELL TYPES. What has been done in and about them” (Oxford University Press, New York, 1968): \"He was born at Frankfurt am Main, descended from a Protestant refugee from Antwerp. He was engaged by the Dutch East India Company in 1671 to work as a type-founder and printer in Java. The comparative crudity of his letter design makes it seems unlikely that he had been trained to cut punches.\"\n\nJohn Fell entrusted him with the cut of the larger bodies: Great Primer Roman and Italic; Double Pica Roman and Italic; French Canon Roman and Italic; Three Lines Pica Roman. De Walpergen cut other types and letters for existing types to be harmonized with the larger bodies. Commented Morison: \"The design of these large Fell Types is difficult to characterize and impossible wholly to approve. It has some affinity with the Dutch work of the second half of the seventeenth century, especially with the bigger size of type shown in the Widow Elsevier’s specimen-sheet of types attributed to Christoffel van Dyck; but De Walpergen went much further in the contrasting weight of thick and thin strokes and his design has crudities about it of which Van Dyck would not have been capable.\"\n\nIn 1686 John Fell died. In his “will” he bequeathed the entire collection of type to the University of Oxford. Remembers Morison: \"This entire collection of ‘founding Materialls of Punchions Matrices Moulds’ was ‘got together’ by John Fell ‘and others at great expense’. Fell’s instructions that they ‘be carefully kept together’ by his executors were duly observed. The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford honourably played their part in sustaining the interests of ‘learning and printing’ and thus the collection was not dissipated but manteined entire.\""

    "description": "I started drawing letters with a computer when I first got one of my own in 1997. I’d been studying sans serif type as a project on the Typography & Graphic Communication course that I was taking at Reading University, and learning about the different strands of development: ‘grotesques’ such as the delightful Monotype Series 215 were designed by type cutters or draftsmen, while geometric and humanist sans serifs like Futura and Gill Sans were constructed with compasses or quills by rationalist typographers and calligraphers. In the end, of course, they all needed a little wash and brush-up from the typefounder – to say nothing of the type designs. I was also in thrall of a typeface called Ehrhardt, a Monotype revival typeface that is based on a seventeenth century design by Miklos Kis. It too had endured a lot of cleaning, but though they were hard on the source material, those responsible created a very elegant condensed typeface. The result looks a bit like a house on an Amsterdam canal.\n\nPuritan was my response to these influences; it was also a way (I thought) that I could get hold of an interesting typeface without unofficially borrowing from the Typography department. It might be flawed, but it was mine! Well, I learned a lot from the experience.\n\nI wrote a short essay about Puritan as a project in my final year as an undergraduate. Rather than repeat it all here, I have converted the essay (presented as a booklet) into a PDF file of around 1200K which you can download.\n\nIn October 1999, I submitted Puritan to the 3rd International Type Design Contest, where it made absolutely no impact."

    "description": "Display families with extensive character sets are rare for any script. With Indian typefaces, large character sets are often even less common. The Indian Type Foundry’s font families have been an exception, however. Sarpanch continues this trend. Sarpanch is an Open Source typeface supporting the Devanagari and Latin scripts. It was designed for use in large point sizes and pixel sizes. Sarpanch’s letterforms are made up of strokes with a high contrast. They are also drawn with wide proportions, based on a squared construction principle.\n\nSix fonts make up the Sarpanch family, ranging in weight from Regular to Black. As weight increases along the family’s axis, vertical strokes become thicker, but the typeface’s horizontals retain the same thickness across each weight. While the rather wide Regular weight of the family is almost monolinear, the Black weight appears to have a very high degree of contrast.\n\nThe Regular, Medium and Semibold fonts are recommended for use in short headlines, while Bold, Heavy and Black are intended primarily for setting single words or pairs. At display sizes, Sarpanch works equally well on screen or in print. Each font contains 1035 glyphs and offers full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written in the Devanagari script.\n\nThe Medium–Black weights of the Sarpanch family were design by Manushi Parikh at ITF in 2014. Jyotish Sonowal designed the Regular weight. Sarpanch is an excellent choice for use in advertising or for news tickers on television screens (breaking news, etc.) In Hindi, the word Sarpanch means ‘the head of a village’."

    "description": "Drawing inspiration from the unusual blend of characteristics observed in the Australian platypus, Platypi combines sharp, heavy wedge serifs usually seen in display faces with more conventional curves and proportions to achieve a practical text typeface with a unique and distinctive visual rhythm. The heavier weights push this tension further with increased stroke tapering and overall contrast. Platypi features six weights with matching italic styles. It supports Indigenous Australian and Vietnamese languages, and includes the full Google Fonts Latin Plus Character Set.\n\nThe word Platypi is commonly used as the plural of platypus; however, it is a form of pseudo-Latin. The correct plural is platypuses.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/d-sargent/platypi."

For instance, a button's size remains constant even when the font weight increases during a hover state. Similarly, making a part of a sentence bolder will not push the letters to the next line.\n\nCalibrated for both display and text applications, Host Grotesk has low contrast stroke modulation and closed terminals that complement the straightforward construction of its letterforms, making it an excellent choice for digital media. The proportions are balanced between a generous geometric sans and a compact grotesque, suitable for both display sizes and small body copy.\n\nThe Host Grotesk family is built on Jonny Pinhorn's beloved Poppins (Indian Type Foundry, 2020). While most letters are reworked and modified for the new look and duplexed proportions, Poppins' soft and approachable essence remains visible. A reliable and cohesive type family for user interfaces, branding, and communication materials, combining the contemporary workhorse category with the elevated functionality of uni-width proportions."

Used at least since the Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BCE) to write the Chinese (Sinitic) languages like Mandarin and Cantonese, but also, today or in the past, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Okinawan, Zhuang, Miao and other languages. The Han script has regional variations: Traditional Chinese (since the 5th century CE, today used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau), Simplified Chinese (used since 1949–1956 in mainland China, Singapore, and Malaysia), Japanese (called Hanji, used together with the Hiragana and Katakana syllabaries in Japan), Korean (called Hanja, widely used for the Korean language since 400 BCE until the mid-20th century). Fundamentally the same characters represent the same or highly related concepts across dialects and languages, which themselves are often mutually unintelligible or completely unrelated. Some 2,100–2,500 Han characters are required for basic literacy, some 5,200–6,300 for reading typical texts. Many more are needed for specialized or historical texts: the Unicode Standard encodes over 94,000 Han characters. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nHangul\nlink\n\nHangul (Hangeul, 한글, Chosŏn'gŭl, 조선글) is an East Asian script, written vertically right-to-left and horizontally left-to-right (79 million users). Used for the Korean language. Created in 1446 by King Sejong the Great (Sejong of Joseon) as a simpler, phonetic alternative to using Chinese hanja for Korean. Not universally accepted for centuries, suppressed by Japanese colonial authorities. Since 1945 the standard script for Korean. The 51 basic letters (jamo) are grouped into syllable blocks depending on their position in the spoken syllable. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nLatin\nlink\n\nLatin (Roman) is a European bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right. The most popular writing system in the world. Used for over 3,000 languages including Latin and Romance languages (Italian, French, Portuguese, Spanish and Romanian), Germanic languages (English, Dutch, German, Nordic languages), Finnish, Malaysian, Indonesian, Filipino, Visayan languages, Turkish, Azerbaijani, Polish, Somali, Vietnamese, and many others. Derived from Western Greek, attested in Rome in the 7th century BCE. In the common era, numerous European languages adopted the Latin script along with Western Christian religion, the script disseminated further with European colonization of the Americas, Australia, parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific. New letters, ligatures and diacritical marks were gradually added to represent the sounds of various languages. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nKatakana\nlink\n\nKatakana (片仮名、カタカナ) is an East Asian syllabary, written vertically right-to-left and horizontally left-to-right (126 million users). Used in Japan for Japanese, Ryukyuan, Ainu and Palauan, and formerly for Taiwanese Hokkien. Katakana is used for transcription of foreign-language words into Japanese, for the writing of loan words, for emphasis, to represent onomatopoeia, for technical and scientific terms, for names of plants, animals and minerals, and often for names of Japanese companies.

Used in Japan for Japanese and the Ryukyuan languages. Hiragana is used to write okurigana (kana suffixes following a kanji root, for example to inflect verbs and adjectives), various grammatical and function words including particles, as well as miscellaneous other native words for which there are no kanji or whose kanji form is obscure or too formal for the writing purpose. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nEmoji symbols\nlink\n\nEmoji symbols are pictograms, logograms, ideograms and smileys used in electronic messages and web pages. Their primary function is to fill in emotional cues otherwise missing from typed conversation. They are typically rendered as multi-color characters. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, r12a.\n\nBopomofo\nlink\n\nBopomofo (注音符號, 注音符号, ㄅㄆㄇㄈ) is an East Asian syllabary, written left-to-right. Developed in 1913 in China to be used for Mandarin Chinese transliteration alongside the Latin-based Wade–Giles system. Also called Mandarin Phonetic Symbols or Zhuyin (注音). Bopomofo is an official transliteration system in Taiwan, used in dictionaries, books, newspapers and journals to annotate the Taiwanese pronunciation of Chinese Han characters, and in electronic input methods. Largely replaced by Pinyin romanization in the People’s Republic of China. Also used as the primary script for Taiwan’s minority languages like Atayal, Taroko, Paiwan and Yami. Has 21 onset consonants, 16 rhymes, and 4 tone marks. Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nCyrillic\nlink\n\nCyrillic is a bicameral alphabet originating in Europe, written left-to-right (250 million users). Used for various languages across Eurasia and is used as the national script in various Slavic, Turkic, Mongolic and Iranic-speaking countries in Southeastern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, North Asia and East Asia, including Russian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Azerbaijani, Kazakh, Tajik, Kyrgyz, Bashkort, Chechen, Chuvash, Avar, Dargwa, Kabardian, Karakalpak, Kumyk, Lezgi, Ossetic, Pontic, Yakut, Buriat and many others. Created in the 9th century. Traditionally attributed to Saint Cyril, a monk from Thessaloniki working in Bulgaria, after earlier creation of the Glagolitic script. Sometimes attributed to Clement of Ohrid, a student of Saint Cyril’s. Initially used for Old Church Slavonic. Reformed in 1708 by Russian tsar Peter the Great. Extended by the Soviet Union in the 20th century to write over 50 languages throughout Eastern Europe and Asia (some of those languages switched to Latin after 1991). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a.\n\nGreek\nlink\n\nGreek (Ελληνικά) is a European bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right (11 million users). Used to write the Greek language since the 8th century BCE. Also used to write other languages like Urum, Albanian Tosk, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish. Some symbols are also used in scientific notation. Derived from Phoenician. First “true alphabet”, with distinct letters for consonants and vowels. Standardized in the 4th century BCE by Eucleides. Has 24 letters. Some letter variants (sigma: σ/ς) have positional significance in the Greek language, other variants only differ in meaning in scientific notation (e.g. pi: π/ϖ). The Greek language used to be written in polytonic spelling, with three accents on vowels. In 1982, Greece introduced monotonic spelling with a single diacritic. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on ScriptSource, Unicode, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, r12a."

    "description": "Anek, as the meaning of the word suggests, is an exercise in multiplicity — multiple scripts designed in multiple weights and widths by multiple designers. A well-informed, conscientious and refreshing interpretation of India’s letter traditions, this family offers a versatile system that can meet the demands of a wide range of applications.\n\nIts expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep structures compact for that graphic texture. On the wide end of the spectrum, the extra legroom lets each letter yawn and stretch into their message. But it is in the boldest weights that Anek comes alive. Sharp terminals and tapered joineries sparkle amidst regimented forms, making this ideal for setting titillating headlines or that magnetic word-mark.\n\nAnek comes in ten scripts: Bangla, Devanagari, Kannada, Latin, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu. The shared aesthetics of this type-family are drawn from a collaboratively decided pool of visual features. At the same time, each script amalgamates influences from its own typographic culture as well as the perspectives of individual designers.\n\nThis project is designed, engineered and maintained by Ek Type; a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces. Contributors of this project are: Maithili Shingre (Anek Malayalam, Anek Kannada), Yesha Goshar (Anek Latin, Anek Odia), Kailash Malviya (Anek Devanagari), Aadarsh Rajan (Anek Tamil), Sulekha Rajkumar (Anek Bangla), Vaishnavi Murthy (Anek Kannada), Omkar Bhoir (Anek Telugu), Mrunmayee Ghaisas (Anek Gujarati), Mahesh Sahu (Anek Odia), and Sarang Kulkarni (Anek Gurmukhi). Project management and design assistance by Noopur Datye, and Font engineering and design assistance by Girish Dalvi.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/EkType/Anek\n\nMultiple scripts for multilingual India\nlink\nThe award-winning Anek variable font\nlink\nThe nine scripts have base characters in the center, with vowel signs and conjuncts that come above, below or next to them.\n\nThe Anek multi-script typeface for 9 Indian languages and Latin was made through a collaboration of 12 type designers working across 8 cities in India.\n\nHow did Ek Type win two type design awards (the TDC Certificate of Typographic Excellence and the D&AD Graphite Pencil) for their Anek multi-script typeface?\n\nThere were two key factors to their success:\n\nTeamwork: The team of 12 collaborated democratically.\nEquality: Giving equal value to each of the nine Indian writing systems (scripts) and Latin, while maintaining both common visual features and script-specific characteristics.\nTeamwork during lockdown\nlink\n\nGetting 12 people to collaborate while speaking in three languages (English, Hindi, and Marathi) and spread out in eight different Indian cities (Mumbai, Pune, Kalyan, Hinganghat, Baroda, Bengaluru, Bharampur, and Pali) is not an easy task.\n\nEk Type established a collaboration structure that fostered teamwork, while also giving designers the liberty to be creative.\n\nThe team consisted of Maithili Shingre, Yesha Goshar, Kailash Malviya, Aadarsh Rajan, Sulekha Rajkumar, Vaishnavi Murthy, Omkar Bhoir, Mrunmayee Ghaisas, Mahesh Sahu, Sarang Kulkarni, Noopur Datye, and Girish Dalvi.\n\nTen people focused on one script each, while the other two members worked on font engineering and project management. The designers focused on the script that was most familiar to them.\n\nVia three- to four-hour weekly video calls, team members annotated drawings with emojis, arrows, text, and other marks in their video conference platform. In between calls, the team collaborated online. The team made design decisions based on majority or unanimous votes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, most of the team had worked together at the Ek Type studio in Mumbai. Remote work created some unforeseen benefits. “Everyone had the time to venture in different directions, not getting colored by what the others were doing,” said Noopur Datye, co-founder and type designer at Ek Type.\n\nTo learn more, read Multilingual scripts for multilingual India."

    "description": "Tiro Devanagari Hindi has its origins in a typeface designed for the Murty Classical Library of India book series, so is especially suited to traditional literary publishing but also made with the needs of today’s multiple print and screen media in mind. The Tiro Devanagari design applies a contemporary approach to the traditional styling of 19th and 20th Century metal types exemplified in those of the renowned Nirnaya Sagar Press, and is characterised by broader proportions, more generous counters, and strong diagonal strokes and terminals. The Hindi font balances traditional and modern forms of conjuncts. For the Open Font License release, Tiro Devanagari Hindi has been extended to support additional characters, and features a new italic companion. Each font also includes a Latin subset including diacritics for transcription of Indian languages.\n\nTiro Devanagari Hindi was designed by John Hudson and Fiona Ross. The italic was adapted by Paul Hanslow.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TiroTypeworks/Indigo.\n\nModern Tiro Indic collection for classical South Asian texts\nlink\nThe beauty and challenges of bridging the old and the new\nlink\n\nTwo type designers separated by an eight-hour time difference, an ocean, and pandemic travel bans collaborated over video calls and email to make a cohesive set of fonts in 8 South Asian languages. In 2012, Harvard University Press commissioned Fiona Ross and John Hudson, through Tiro Typeworks, to design typefaces for the Murty Classical Library of India book series. The publisher needed to reprint ancient Indian literary, historical, and religious texts, including Vedic and early Sanskrit works. Since these old texts had been printed using traditional letterforms and early Indian typography techniques, the new fonts needed to retain some of the traditional style of the old texts, yet be clear and legible in modern print and digital media.\n\nIn 2019 Google Fonts approached Tiro to make an extended and updated version of the Murty Fonts to be released as open source fonts in the Tiro Indic collection, offering users traditional text styles suitable for a variety of uses.\n\nStudy the classics and language structure\nlink\n\nBefore designing the typefaces, it was important to research classical texts and understand the unique characteristics of the languages.\n\n“We looked at very lovely manuscripts or early Indian printed materials from the 18th or 19th Centuries,” said John Hudson.\n\nTo learn more, read Modern Tiro Indic collection for classical South Asian texts."

    "description": "Modak is a sweet plump Devanagari+Latin display typeface with portly curves and thin counters. It is Unicode compliant and is open sourced under the SIL Open Font License v1.1.\n\nModak began as a heavy hand-sketched letterform exploration in Devanagari with cute, adorable characters whose curves merged into each other, forming distinct counter shapes. As we translated these into a functional font, each character was fine-tuned and multiple matras designed to match precisely with every character. Unlike the conventional approach the post-base matras in Modak overlap the consonants. Likewise overlapping ukars were also designed leaving thin counters in between. Rather than being a mere composite of 2 separate glyphs, every conjunct was redrawn as a single entity. The challenge was to maintain legibility and consistency in the thin white counter spaces across all characters irrespective of their structural complexity.\n\nThe resulting typeface is one of its kind and most likely the chubbiest Devanagari typeface to be designed so far. Modak Devanagari is designed by Sarang Kulkarni and Maithili Shingre and Modak Latin by Noopur Datye with support from Girish Dalvi.\n\nWe are immensely thankful to Santosh Kshirsagar, Pradnya Naik and Yashodeep Gholap for their suggestions and feedback during the font design process. We are also grateful to our friends from the Industrial Design Centre, IIT Bombay and Sir J J Institute of Applied Art for their support and encouragement.\n\nThis project is led by Ek Type, a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces.

Unusually this type includes lowercase letters. The high x-height gives the text a compact look, true to the original Cooperplate Gothic design. The general form is less condensed. It has diagonal stress, and a soft variation in contrast to improve legibility. It is bolder than normal for better rasterization on screen. The typeface works smoothly at text sizes with its delicate serifs, which gives a crisp effect on the screen. At larger sizes it shows a strong personality with the combination of serif details and the modulation of its strokes. It is useful for both short text and headlines, but it is also comfortable for reading on screen.\n\nDesigned by Dario Muhafara for tipo foundry."

It was a lot of this at the end of my work. I decided create new fonts based on these letters. And finally I created six fonts family and named these fonts Nova (NovaCut, NovaFlat, NovaOval, NovaRound, NovaSlim, NovaSquare - by the shape of individual fonts). At last I created monospace font - NovaMono - the seventh part of this family."

Gemunu Libre comes in 7 weights from Extra Light to Extra Bold, and each weight contains the complete Sinhala script and a matching Latin characters.\n\nThe project is led by Mooniak in collaboration with Pushpananda Ekanayake. Latin set is designed by Sol Matas. Initial development and release was funded by Google Fonts in 2015.

While weights, widths and optical sizes were carefully crafted to work well in an Australian classroom environment, they are just as comfortable to read and work with in the home environment.\n\nEach Australian state teaches different handwriting styles in lower primary school (although some states do share the same style). There are essentially three stages involved with each state's styles:\n\nThe foundational stage involves learning basic letter formation.\nThe transitional stage adds joining ligatures to some letters.\nThe cursive stage joins almost all letters (with some exceptions).\n\nThe SA School Fonts include:\n\nSouth Australia Beginner Alphabet - a simple sloped print for early primary school.\nStudents in South Australia learn the Beginners Alphabet from years 1 and 2, moving on to Pre-Cursive from year 3.\n\nGoogle Workspace users are provided standard versions online, however they may download or build the complete OpenType versions from GitHub for local installations. To download the full version, or to contribute, see github.com/MezMerrit/AU-School-Handwriting-Fonts.\n\nThe handwriting fonts that help Australian students learn how to read and write are now available in Google Workspace\nlink\n\nGoogle for Education Australia and Google Fonts partnered to make Foundation Fonts for Australian Schools available on Google Workspace, including Google Workspace for Education. The fonts are also available for download from the Google Fonts website.\n\nAustralian teachers are required to use state-mandated handwriting styles to teach reading and writing to school children from ages four to nine. Designed by Tina and Corey Anderson, the five Foundation Fonts exemplify proper handwriting for English and other languages using the Latin writing system, and include common math symbols. The regular weight of each font imitates the pencil thickness of handwriting, making the fonts easy for students to recognize as they learn how to write letter shapes.\n\nThe availability of these fonts on Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides is also important for the adoption of Chromebooks and Google Workspace for Education in Australian schools.\n\nTo read more, visit The handwriting fonts that help Australian students learn how to read and write are now available in Google Workspace"

    "description": "A perfect blend of pointy paws in a coat of fur, Baloo is an affable display typeface by Ek Type. Available in nine Indian scripts plus Arabic along with a Latin counterpart, the family is Unicode compliant and libre licensed.\n\nBaloo 2 is an extension of the earlier Baloo project. The new Baloo 2 includes additional glyphs, engineering improvements, and has been extended to five weights, ranging from the light footed Regular to the affable ExtraBold. The lighter weights retain Baloo’s characteristic bounce, but they do so slightly, infusing life into each word. This allows the new family to freely fraternise with texts of all sizes and temperaments — be it short bursts or copious reams, demanding headlines or whispering bylines. Carefree yet confident, sprightly yet versatile, the renewed family of Baloo promises to bring warmth to every project.\n\nThe Baloo 2 project consists of ten font families with unique local names for each of the nine Indic scripts plus Arabic (Baloo Bhaijaan 2). Each family supports one Indic/Arabic script plus Latin, Latin Extended, and Vietnamese.\n\nIt took a team of committed type designers to rear Baloo and raise it to be the typeface we love. The Gurmukhi is designed by Shuchita Grover; Bangla by Noopur Datye and Sulekha Rajkumar; Odia by Yesha Goshar, Manish Minz, and Shuchita Grover; Gujarati by Noopur Datye and Supriya Tembe; Kannada by Divya Kowshik and Shuchita Grover; Telugu by Maithili Shingre and Omkar Shende; Malayalam by Maithili Shingre and Unnati Kotecha; and Tamil by Aadarsh Rajan.

The special thing about these forms is the warm feeling that they give to your text, because of the particular rounded glyph shapes that emerge. As a result, the Overlock typeface family is great for titles and short texts in magazine style layouts. It looks its very best at bigger sizes. The main Overlock family comes in three weights, Regular, Bold and Black, each with a true italic. It has two set of numbers and small caps, which are available in this sister family."

The primary goal was to create a design that will prove popular because it resonates with both casual and professional designers, and without ever lowering the quality of the design. Each font in the family was extensively tested on low resolution phones and refined to work well as a web font in the mobile era. From the very first round of design testing, each font was hinted with ttfautohint and refined for Windows users.\n\nArima Madurai has an extended language support for the Tamil and Latin scripts, as well as Malayalam and Greek.\n\nGreek developed during Google Summer of Code 2017 by Rosalie Wagner, under the mentorship of Emilios Theofanous and Irene Vlachou.\"\n\nThe Arima project is led by NDISCOVER, a type design foundry based in Portugal.

This feature becomes visible from 36 pt and above. In body sizes stroke cuts enrich the typographic color with light nuances.\n\nDesigned by Alexei Vanyashin in cooperation with Olexa Volochay and Vladimir Pavlikov."

For this purpose the strokes are deliberatly kept vertical and diagonal cuts have a 45° angle, outlines are rounded.\n\nFeatures like wide proportions and generous x-height are introduced for better legibility. Unconventional and simplified letterforms like k, f, r aid readability at small sizes. While at display sizes they add a crisp and sharp impression.\n\nUppercase letters are decently heavier compared to lowercase as a tribute to the old typographic tradition. This way uppercase is easily distinguished from lowercase, and allows scaling down to be used as Small Caps.\n\nBecause of its ascetic modular character and squarish proportions Iceland webfont is easily integrated in modular grids and logotypes."

    "description": "Asar is an original Devanagari and Latin typeface that is based on an expanding brush stroke following a heart line. The design is meant to work well with long texts while maintaining a certain charm at large sizes. Asar is partially derived from Pria Ravichadran's Palanquin, starting by interpreting that design's overall proportions and heart lines and glyph set and OpenType features.\n\nThe design arrives at its own identity by adjusting for the density of certain brush strokes, that dictate wider spacing and new forms. The brush used is the Expand Path feature of Fontlab Studio 5, using a width of 93, an angle of -55, and a roundness of 35. In general the letters are designed so as to not require further adjustment, but where this is not satisfying then manual adjustments are made.\n\nThis project is led by Sorkin Type, an international type foundry based in Boston.

At that point Google Fonts had fewer than 10 Japanese families, most of which were basic Mincho (serif) and gothic (sans) designs. Since then the collection of Japanese fonts within the library has grown, now with 38 font families from 18 designers, in a variety of styles – from formal text types to fun display fonts. All these Japanese fonts are now live on Google Fonts for anyone to test out and use in any project.\n\nThe Zen Fonts collection is the largest set of Japanese fonts on Google Fonts\nlink\n\nAs part of this larger effort to expand Japanese offerings, Google Fonts collaborated with type designer Yoshimichi Ohira to open his prestigious collection of Zen Fonts typefaces to the public. With 23 Japanese and three Latin fonts in various styles of mincho (serif), gothic (sans serif), maru (rounded), and display styles, the Zen Fonts collection is now the largest set of Japanese fonts in Google Fonts’ expansive library, and is also available in Adobe Fonts.

    "description": "STANLEY MORISON, in his “THE ROMAN ITALIC & BLACK LETTER bequeathed to the University of Oxford by Dr. JOHN FELL” (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1951), began this way the description of the FELL TYPES: \"The Oxford Printing house holds the oldest punches and matrices surviving in England, material not only treasured but used; types cast therefrom being employed for the composition of books and other printed matter.\"\n\nIt’s essentially the inheritance of the will of John Fell, D.D. who died on 10 July 1686, aged 61, Bishop of Oxford and Dean of Christ Church. Since 1668 he spent his life creating a ‘learned press’ in Oxford, endowed with invaluable equipment, setting a high standard for the future of his publishing.\n\nHe wrote: \"The foundation of all successe must be layd in doing things well, and I am sure that will not be don with English letters\" (to Jenkins, 2 Dec. 1672). So he collectected types available in the foreign market: mainly France, Holland and Germany. Fell decided to develop types in its own ‘workhouse’ too.\n\nPeter De Walpergen became his personal type-founder. Says Harry Carter in “THE FELL TYPES. What has been done in and about them” (Oxford University Press, New York, 1968): \"He was born at Frankfurt am Main, descended from a Protestant refugee from Antwerp. He was engaged by the Dutch East India Company in 1671 to work as a type-founder and printer in Java. The comparative crudity of his letter design makes it seems unlikely that he had been trained to cut punches.\"\n\nJohn Fell entrusted him with the cut of the larger bodies: Great Primer Roman and Italic; Double Pica Roman and Italic; French Canon Roman and Italic; Three Lines Pica Roman. De Walpergen cut other types and letters for existing types to be harmonized with the larger bodies. Commented Morison: \"The design of these large Fell Types is difficult to characterize and impossible wholly to approve. It has some affinity with the Dutch work of the second half of the seventeenth century, especially with the bigger size of type shown in the Widow Elsevier’s specimen-sheet of types attributed to Christoffel van Dyck; but De Walpergen went much further in the contrasting weight of thick and thin strokes and his design has crudities about it of which Van Dyck would not have been capable.\"\n\nIn 1686 John Fell died. In his “will” he bequeathed the entire collection of type to the University of Oxford. Remembers Morison: \"This entire collection of ‘founding Materialls of Punchions Matrices Moulds’ was ‘got together’ by John Fell ‘and others at great expense’. Fell’s instructions that they ‘be carefully kept together’ by his executors were duly observed. The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford honourably played their part in sustaining the interests of ‘learning and printing’ and thus the collection was not dissipated but manteined entire.\""

    "description": "Rhodium Libre was designed for use on screens at small sizes and the Latin and Devanagari scripts. To that end, the design is generally uncomplicated and coarse, lacking the small details that are lost on screens; this also reduces the file size to improve latency when used as a web font. The letters are designed slightly wide, with open counters, a large x-height in the Latin glyphs, and so on. The Devanagari glyphs are the same height as the Latin capitals to allow them to stand alongside the oversized Latin lowercase.\n\nHistorical models for Rhodium’s design are Fortune (AKA Volta) by Konrad Bauer and Walter Baum, and Rex by Intertype. Matthew Carter’s Verdana provided insight into designing type for small sizes and adverse reading environments.\n\nThe Devanagari glyph set supports contemporary Hindi, Marathi, and Nepali. The Latin glyph set supports Adobe’s Latin-3 character set.\n\nThis project is led by Dunwich Type Founders, a type foundry based in Denver, Colorado, USA, who design contemporary typeface families.

It was created by two designers with very different ideas, who took advantage of their divergent criteria to draw glyphs that made the Upright and Italic styles converge without mixing them.\n\nIn this way, it was possible to converge the inclination of an Upright Sans Serif with a Sans Serif Italic. Looking at the font in detail, the bottom halves of the glyphs have Transitive serifs while the upper halves conserve the Sans Serif terminals. Other specific details can be seen in the a, g, and e glyphs, which have an Italic structure, not an Upright one. In addition, the glyph for the letter r has a relatively closed instroke.\n\nThe references used to develop this font were Bree from TypeTogether, Parisine de Porchez Typofonderie, and, undeniably, Ludovico Degli Arrighi's manuscript about the structure the \"humanistic cursive\" that is Convergence.\n\nDesigned by Nicola‡s Silva (@zar_nicolas20) and John Vargas (@vargas74)"

These features attempt to solve the problems of spatial economy and print fidelity that dictionary typesetting presents. Ink traps were applied with consideration for the aesthetic and functional requirements. Voces was selected for exhibition in Tipos Latinos 2010.\n\nVoces is designed by Ana Paula Megda and Pablo Ugerman.

The letters on these wooden trail and directional signs are a system of paths, points, and curves that a router follows. The router’s \"bit\" follows the path and gives the letters its stroke weight or thickness when engraving a sign. National Park Typeface walks along the path of both honoring the quirky nature of the forms being created by a router bit and optimizing the forms to work in a variety of sizes and languages for print, web, and mobile platforms.\n\n \n\nThe design of each character begins with a vector skeleton, represented by a series of coordinates that a router would typically interpret and carve into a wooden sign. From there adjustments were made to each skeleton to ensure comfortable legibility at different weights, and we also incorporate optical adjustments where the capabilities of an analog router falls short. The result is a typeface that stays true to its unique inspiration, maintaining its inviting warmth and distinctive character. It can be effectively utilized across a wide range of applications while preserving the essence that makes it truly special."

Its letterforms are inspired by Bauhaus typefaces and preconstructivist forms.\n\nThe concept of the typeface fits with Moholy-Nagy's typography statement that type must be clear, legible, and communicate its message.\n\nThe main distinctive features are the sharp corners in MVW, curved Z and unicase-like N. Contrast is monolinear and proportions are balanced.\n\nBaumans is suitable for medium to large sizes and optimized for screen.\n\nDesigned by Henadij Zarechnjuk."

    "description": "Anek, as the meaning of the word suggests, is an exercise in multiplicity — multiple scripts designed in multiple weights and widths by multiple designers. A well-informed, conscientious and refreshing interpretation of India’s letter traditions, this family offers a versatile system that can meet the demands of a wide range of applications.\n\nIts expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep structures compact for that graphic texture. On the wide end of the spectrum, the extra legroom lets each letter yawn and stretch into their message. But it is in the boldest weights that Anek comes alive. Sharp terminals and tapered joineries sparkle amidst regimented forms, making this ideal for setting titillating headlines or that magnetic word-mark.\n\nAnek comes in ten scripts: Bangla, Devanagari, Kannada, Latin, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu. The shared aesthetics of this type-family are drawn from a collaboratively decided pool of visual features. At the same time, each script amalgamates influences from its own typographic culture as well as the perspectives of individual designers.\n\nThis project is designed, engineered and maintained by Ek Type; a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces. Contributors of this project are: Maithili Shingre (Anek Malayalam, Anek Kannada), Yesha Goshar (Anek Latin, Anek Odia), Kailash Malviya (Anek Devanagari), Aadarsh Rajan (Anek Tamil), Sulekha Rajkumar (Anek Bangla), Vaishnavi Murthy (Anek Kannada), Omkar Bhoir (Anek Telugu), Mrunmayee Ghaisas (Anek Gujarati), Mahesh Sahu (Anek Odia), and Sarang Kulkarni (Anek Gurmukhi). Project management and design assistance by Noopur Datye, and Font engineering and design assistance by Girish Dalvi.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/EkType/Anek\n\nMultiple scripts for multilingual India\nlink\nThe award-winning Anek variable font\nlink\nThe nine scripts have base characters in the center, with vowel signs and conjuncts that come above, below or next to them.\n\nThe Anek multi-script typeface for 9 Indian languages and Latin was made through a collaboration of 12 type designers working across 8 cities in India.\n\nHow did Ek Type win two type design awards (the TDC Certificate of Typographic Excellence and the D&AD Graphite Pencil) for their Anek multi-script typeface?\n\nThere were two key factors to their success:\n\nTeamwork: The team of 12 collaborated democratically.\nEquality: Giving equal value to each of the nine Indian writing systems (scripts) and Latin, while maintaining both common visual features and script-specific characteristics.\nTeamwork during lockdown\nlink\n\nGetting 12 people to collaborate while speaking in three languages (English, Hindi, and Marathi) and spread out in eight different Indian cities (Mumbai, Pune, Kalyan, Hinganghat, Baroda, Bengaluru, Bharampur, and Pali) is not an easy task.\n\nEk Type established a collaboration structure that fostered teamwork, while also giving designers the liberty to be creative.\n\nThe team consisted of Maithili Shingre, Yesha Goshar, Kailash Malviya, Aadarsh Rajan, Sulekha Rajkumar, Vaishnavi Murthy, Omkar Bhoir, Mrunmayee Ghaisas, Mahesh Sahu, Sarang Kulkarni, Noopur Datye, and Girish Dalvi.\n\nTen people focused on one script each, while the other two members worked on font engineering and project management. The designers focused on the script that was most familiar to them.\n\nVia three- to four-hour weekly video calls, team members annotated drawings with emojis, arrows, text, and other marks in their video conference platform. In between calls, the team collaborated online. The team made design decisions based on majority or unanimous votes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, most of the team had worked together at the Ek Type studio in Mumbai. Remote work created some unforeseen benefits. “Everyone had the time to venture in different directions, not getting colored by what the others were doing,” said Noopur Datye, co-founder and type designer at Ek Type.\n\nTo learn more, read Multilingual scripts for multilingual India."

Katibeh has ligatures that Arabic and Persian readers are familiar with, to make it comfortable for reading longer texts. Unlike many other Arabic fonts, Katibeh includes a Latin typeface designed for harmony with the Arabic to make it useful for multilingual texts.\n\nThe Latin is scaled to work best with the Arabic component.\n\nThe Katibeh project is led by KB Studio, a design studio in Los Angeles.

This makes the typeface very amusing. HennyPenny is a headline typeface for use in large size fonts. It may be used for childrens books, magazines and websites.\n\nDesigned by Olga Umpeleva for Brownfox. To contribute to the project contact Gayaneh Bagdasaryan."

    "description": "In the crowded urban environment, space for signage is always at a premium. From crummy liquor stores to majestic theaters, sometimes signs have nowhere to go but up.\n\nBungee is a font that celebrates urban signs that stack the Latin alphabet, one letter on top of the other, in order to make dramatic use of limited space. Following their lead, Bungee typesets horizontally and vertically, so it is always ready to take your text in a new direction.\n\nBungee’s letterforms were designed to reinforce a sense of verticality. Round characters like O and diagonal characters like A are straight-sided, and letters like L and I gain serifs in order to create vertical words with well-defined left and right edges.\n\nThis font uses the COLRv0 and CPAL tables. Please visit the gf-guide color page to learn more about Color Fonts technology.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/djrrb/Bungee\n\nBungee’s color fonts\nlink\n\nBungee was an early experimental color font, and has been updated as color font technology has developed over the past decade. Both Bungee Tint (flat colors) and Bungee Spice (gradients) contain multiple color palettes, so it is possible to create chromatic effects even in the most basic typesetting environments. Hopefully these fonts will help designers and developers explore the possibilities of what color fonts have to offer.\n\nThe Bungee family\nlink\n\nGoogle Fonts distributes seven variants of Bungee, including two color fonts:\n\nBungee\nBungee Hairline\nBungee Inline\nBungee Outline\nBungee Shade\nBungee Tint, a COLRv0 font\nBungee Spice, a COLRv1 font\n\nBungee’s downloadable releases also includes special layer fonts (for multicolor typesetting in environments where color fonts are not supported) and rotated fonts (for stacked typesetting in environments where vertical text is not supported).\n\nThe Bungee project is led by David Jonathan Ross, and thanks to support from Google and The Font Bureau, Bungee was released under the SIL Open Font License.\n\nIn 2023–24, Marte Verhaegen and Just van Rossum produced a major revision (v2), which includes an automated build process as well as many enhancements to the vertical features and color fonts."

    "description": "Anek, as the meaning of the word suggests, is an exercise in multiplicity — multiple scripts designed in multiple weights and widths by multiple designers. A well-informed, conscientious and refreshing interpretation of India’s letter traditions, this family offers a versatile system that can meet the demands of a wide range of applications.\n\nIts expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep structures compact for that graphic texture. On the wide end of the spectrum, the extra legroom lets each letter yawn and stretch into their message. But it is in the boldest weights that Anek comes alive. Sharp terminals and tapered joineries sparkle amidst regimented forms, making this ideal for setting titillating headlines or that magnetic word-mark.\n\nAnek comes in ten scripts: Bangla, Devanagari, Kannada, Latin, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu. The shared aesthetics of this type-family are drawn from a collaboratively decided pool of visual features. At the same time, each script amalgamates influences from its own typographic culture as well as the perspectives of individual designers.\n\nThis project is designed, engineered and maintained by Ek Type; a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces. Contributors of this project are: Maithili Shingre (Anek Malayalam, Anek Kannada), Yesha Goshar (Anek Latin, Anek Odia), Kailash Malviya (Anek Devanagari), Aadarsh Rajan (Anek Tamil), Sulekha Rajkumar (Anek Bangla), Vaishnavi Murthy (Anek Kannada), Omkar Bhoir (Anek Telugu), Mrunmayee Ghaisas (Anek Gujarati), Mahesh Sahu (Anek Odia), and Sarang Kulkarni (Anek Gurmukhi). Project management and design assistance by Noopur Datye, and Font engineering and design assistance by Girish Dalvi.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/EkType/Anek\n\nMultiple scripts for multilingual India\nlink\nThe award-winning Anek variable font\nlink\nThe nine scripts have base characters in the center, with vowel signs and conjuncts that come above, below or next to them.\n\nThe Anek multi-script typeface for 9 Indian languages and Latin was made through a collaboration of 12 type designers working across 8 cities in India.\n\nHow did Ek Type win two type design awards (the TDC Certificate of Typographic Excellence and the D&AD Graphite Pencil) for their Anek multi-script typeface?\n\nThere were two key factors to their success:\n\nTeamwork: The team of 12 collaborated democratically.\nEquality: Giving equal value to each of the nine Indian writing systems (scripts) and Latin, while maintaining both common visual features and script-specific characteristics.\nTeamwork during lockdown\nlink\n\nGetting 12 people to collaborate while speaking in three languages (English, Hindi, and Marathi) and spread out in eight different Indian cities (Mumbai, Pune, Kalyan, Hinganghat, Baroda, Bengaluru, Bharampur, and Pali) is not an easy task.\n\nEk Type established a collaboration structure that fostered teamwork, while also giving designers the liberty to be creative.\n\nThe team consisted of Maithili Shingre, Yesha Goshar, Kailash Malviya, Aadarsh Rajan, Sulekha Rajkumar, Vaishnavi Murthy, Omkar Bhoir, Mrunmayee Ghaisas, Mahesh Sahu, Sarang Kulkarni, Noopur Datye, and Girish Dalvi.\n\nTen people focused on one script each, while the other two members worked on font engineering and project management. The designers focused on the script that was most familiar to them.\n\nVia three- to four-hour weekly video calls, team members annotated drawings with emojis, arrows, text, and other marks in their video conference platform. In between calls, the team collaborated online. The team made design decisions based on majority or unanimous votes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, most of the team had worked together at the Ek Type studio in Mumbai. Remote work created some unforeseen benefits. “Everyone had the time to venture in different directions, not getting colored by what the others were doing,” said Noopur Datye, co-founder and type designer at Ek Type.\n\nTo learn more, read Multilingual scripts for multilingual India."

Its features include carefully designed serifs, gradual stroke and marked contrast, calligraphic and humanistic forms, and large ascenders and descenders. It is designed to work well in long texts with generous line spacing. It originates from work presented to the post-graduate course in Typeface Design at the University of Buenos Aires in 2011.\n\nRosarivo is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support other scripts.

An adult re-reads a news article and still doesn’t understand what it’s about. Both readers end up frustrated and feeling like there is something wrong with them. Thankfully there might be a simple answer. Dr. Bonnie Shaver-Troup thinks fonts are part of the problem and the solution to many reading problems.\n\n“We have a global reading crisis and we can change much of it by delivering fonts that are optimized for the visual field and for the individual. The answer is hidden in plain sight. It’s the font,” said Shaver-Troup.\n\nChange the font, change the outcome\nlink\n\nWhile working as an educational therapist in Silicon Valley, Shaver-Troup helped students with dyslexia and other reading problems to learn to read. She experimented by changing the spacing between certain letters in their reading assignments, and found that it improved their reading and comprehension. According to Shaver-Troup, the issue wasn’t in her students’ minds, it was with the letterforms they saw on the screen or paper.\n\n“The majority of the reading problems, including dyslexia, are not cognitive or phonological. They are visual or perceptual. Our testing has a built-in design flaw. We use fonts to deliver text for reading that are too tight for efficient or successful visual processing. Then we get poor results, suggesting the reading issue is phonological or cognitive. If we change the font to the tested optimized font fit, then we change the outcome,” she explained.\n\nTo learn more, read:\nClean and clear: making reading easier with Lexend (English)\nPartnering to change how the world reads (English)\nEine Partnerschaft mit dem Ziel, das Leseerlebnis weltweit zu verändern: Erweiterung von Lexend um verschiedene Schriftstärken (German)"

    "description": "STANLEY MORISON, in his “THE ROMAN ITALIC & BLACK LETTER bequeathed to the University of Oxford by Dr. JOHN FELL” (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1951), began this way the description of the FELL TYPES: \"The Oxford Printing house holds the oldest punches and matrices surviving in England, material not only treasured but used; types cast therefrom being employed for the composition of books and other printed matter.\"\n\nIt’s essentially the inheritance of the will of John Fell, D.D. who died on 10 July 1686, aged 61, Bishop of Oxford and Dean of Christ Church. Since 1668 he spent his life creating a ‘learned press’ in Oxford, endowed with invaluable equipment, setting a high standard for the future of his publishing.\n\nHe wrote: \"The foundation of all successe must be layd in doing things well, and I am sure that will not be don with English letters\" (to Jenkins, 2 Dec. 1672). So he collectected types available in the foreign market: mainly France, Holland and Germany. Fell decided to develop types in its own ‘workhouse’ too.\n\nPeter De Walpergen became his personal type-founder. Says Harry Carter in “THE FELL TYPES. What has been done in and about them” (Oxford University Press, New York, 1968): \"He was born at Frankfurt am Main, descended from a Protestant refugee from Antwerp. He was engaged by the Dutch East India Company in 1671 to work as a type-founder and printer in Java. The comparative crudity of his letter design makes it seems unlikely that he had been trained to cut punches.\"\n\nJohn Fell entrusted him with the cut of the larger bodies: Great Primer Roman and Italic; Double Pica Roman and Italic; French Canon Roman and Italic; Three Lines Pica Roman. De Walpergen cut other types and letters for existing types to be harmonized with the larger bodies. Commented Morison: \"The design of these large Fell Types is difficult to characterize and impossible wholly to approve. It has some affinity with the Dutch work of the second half of the seventeenth century, especially with the bigger size of type shown in the Widow Elsevier’s specimen-sheet of types attributed to Christoffel van Dyck; but De Walpergen went much further in the contrasting weight of thick and thin strokes and his design has crudities about it of which Van Dyck would not have been capable.\"\n\nIn 1686 John Fell died. In his “will” he bequeathed the entire collection of type to the University of Oxford. Remembers Morison: \"This entire collection of ‘founding Materialls of Punchions Matrices Moulds’ was ‘got together’ by John Fell ‘and others at great expense’. Fell’s instructions that they ‘be carefully kept together’ by his executors were duly observed. The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford honourably played their part in sustaining the interests of ‘learning and printing’ and thus the collection was not dissipated but manteined entire.\""

It was a lot of this at the end of my work. I decided create new fonts based on these letters. And finally I created six fonts family and named these fonts Nova (NovaCut, NovaFlat, NovaOval, NovaRound, NovaSlim, NovaSquare - by the shape of individual fonts). At last I created monospace font - NovaMono - the seventh part of this family."

    "description": "STANLEY MORISON, in his “THE ROMAN ITALIC & BLACK LETTER bequeathed to the University of Oxford by Dr. JOHN FELL” (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1951), began this way the description of the FELL TYPES: \"The Oxford Printing house holds the oldest punches and matrices surviving in England, material not only treasured but used; types cast therefrom being employed for the composition of books and other printed matter.\"\n\nIt’s essentially the inheritance of the will of John Fell, D.D. who died on 10 July 1686, aged 61, Bishop of Oxford and Dean of Christ Church. Since 1668 he spent his life creating a ‘learned press’ in Oxford, endowed with invaluable equipment, setting a high standard for the future of his publishing.\n\nHe wrote: \"The foundation of all successe must be layd in doing things well, and I am sure that will not be don with English letters\" (to Jenkins, 2 Dec. 1672). So he collectected types available in the foreign market: mainly France, Holland and Germany. Fell decided to develop types in its own ‘workhouse’ too.\n\nPeter De Walpergen became his personal type-founder. Says Harry Carter in “THE FELL TYPES. What has been done in and about them” (Oxford University Press, New York, 1968): \"He was born at Frankfurt am Main, descended from a Protestant refugee from Antwerp. He was engaged by the Dutch East India Company in 1671 to work as a type-founder and printer in Java. The comparative crudity of his letter design makes it seems unlikely that he had been trained to cut punches.\"\n\nJohn Fell entrusted him with the cut of the larger bodies: Great Primer Roman and Italic; Double Pica Roman and Italic; French Canon Roman and Italic; Three Lines Pica Roman. De Walpergen cut other types and letters for existing types to be harmonized with the larger bodies. Commented Morison: \"The design of these large Fell Types is difficult to characterize and impossible wholly to approve. It has some affinity with the Dutch work of the second half of the seventeenth century, especially with the bigger size of type shown in the Widow Elsevier’s specimen-sheet of types attributed to Christoffel van Dyck; but De Walpergen went much further in the contrasting weight of thick and thin strokes and his design has crudities about it of which Van Dyck would not have been capable.\"\n\nIn 1686 John Fell died. In his “will” he bequeathed the entire collection of type to the University of Oxford. Remembers Morison: \"This entire collection of ‘founding Materialls of Punchions Matrices Moulds’ was ‘got together’ by John Fell ‘and others at great expense’. Fell’s instructions that they ‘be carefully kept together’ by his executors were duly observed. The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford honourably played their part in sustaining the interests of ‘learning and printing’ and thus the collection was not dissipated but manteined entire.\""

    "description": "In Germany, education is regulated at the state level rather than at the national level. Each state defines its own models and methods of teaching handwriting in primary schools. The common goal is acquiring a personal style of connected handwriting at the end of primary school in fourth grade (10-11 years old). Emphasis is on the flow of connected writing, letter recognition, and legibility, not the exact imitation of individual letters.\n\nIn most states, teachers and schools can choose from three cursive styles: Ausgangsschrift (LA), Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift (VA), and Schulausgangsschrift (SAS). But in 2010, the Grundschulverband, or Association of Primary Schools, presented an alternative progressive approach for handwriting teaching: Grundschrift, based primarily on a print-style script with some added cursive elements, like Häckchen, or exit strokes. Some German states, like Bremen and Hamburg, allow this method to be used in schools, in addition to the dominant Ausgangschrift systems. According to Das Deutsche Schulportal, Grundschrift is taught in 10% of all German schools.\n\nPlaywrite Deutschland Grundschrift is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite DE Grund Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Deutschland Grundschrift characteristics\nlink\n\nThis style is a simple precursive, entirely disconnected. The uppercase letters are simplified print forms, notable for a two-stroke 'R' and an 'M' with a raised middle point. Several lowercase letters retain the characteristic exit stroke typical of precursives. The letter 'k' is constructed using two strokes, and the 'f' features a straight descender, distinguishing it within this straightforward style.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Deutschland Grundschrift appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘DE’ and a the ‘Grund’ abbreviation, Playwrite DE Grund. It features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in Germany, see primarium.info/countries/germany.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer. Navigate to where you saved the font file and double-click it to open. Click the \"Install\" button at the top of the font preview window. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nmacOS: After downloading the font file to your Mac, right-click it in Finder and select \"Open With\" > \"Font Book\". Then, click \"Install Font\" in the font preview window that pops up. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nHow to use the fonts in apps?\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually activated.\n\nNote: This font family doesn't include Bold or Italic styles, so please avoid applying them in text editors. If you use the common 'B' and 'I' buttons, you will automatically generate low-quality styles.\n\nGoogle Docs and Slides: From the font selector drop-down, go to \"More Fonts\" and search for the desired font name, in this case, \"Playwrite DE Grund\", and click OK. If some text is already selected, the font choice will apply.\n\nMicrosoft Word: Go to Format in the Menu bar, select Font, and then the Advanced tab. Activate \"Contextual Alternates\" and \"Kerning for fonts below\" to apply these settings to all text sizes.\n\nLibreOffice: In macOS, to select the different styles, go to Format in the Menu bar, select Character, and use the Typeface menu.\n\nAdobe InDesign: Open the Paragraph Panel and select Adobe \"World-Ready Paragraph Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Illustrator: Navigate to Preferences > Type, check the \"Show Indic Options\" box, and close preferences. Then open the Paragraph Panel and select \"Middle Eastern Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Photoshop: Access the Paragraph Panel, then choose \"World-Ready Layout\" from the contextual menu.\n\nThe above instructions are also available in PDF format here."

    "description": "A perfect blend of pointy paws in a coat of fur, Baloo is an affable display typeface by Ek Type. Available in nine Indian scripts plus Arabic along with a Latin counterpart, the family is Unicode compliant and libre licensed.\n\nBaloo 2 is an extension of the earlier Baloo project. The new Baloo 2 includes additional glyphs, engineering improvements, and has been extended to five weights, ranging from the light footed Regular to the affable ExtraBold. The lighter weights retain Baloo’s characteristic bounce, but they do so slightly, infusing life into each word. This allows the new family to freely fraternise with texts of all sizes and temperaments — be it short bursts or copious reams, demanding headlines or whispering bylines. Carefree yet confident, sprightly yet versatile, the renewed family of Baloo promises to bring warmth to every project.\n\nThe Baloo 2 project consists of ten font families with unique local names for each of the nine Indic scripts plus Arabic (Baloo Bhaijaan 2). Each family supports one Indic/Arabic script plus Latin, Latin Extended, and Vietnamese.\n\nIt took a team of committed type designers to rear Baloo and raise it to be the typeface we love. The Gurmukhi is designed by Shuchita Grover; Bangla by Noopur Datye and Sulekha Rajkumar; Odia by Yesha Goshar, Manish Minz, and Shuchita Grover; Gujarati by Noopur Datye and Supriya Tembe; Kannada by Divya Kowshik and Shuchita Grover; Telugu by Maithili Shingre and Omkar Shende; Malayalam by Maithili Shingre and Unnati Kotecha; and Tamil by Aadarsh Rajan. Baloo Devanagari and Latin are collaboratively designed by Ek Type. Font engineering and type design assistance by Girish Dalvi.\n\nTo contribute to the project, visit github.com/EkType/Baloo2"

    "description": "STANLEY MORISON, in his “THE ROMAN ITALIC & BLACK LETTER bequeathed to the University of Oxford by Dr. JOHN FELL” (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1951), began this way the description of the FELL TYPES: \"The Oxford Printing house holds the oldest punches and matrices surviving in England, material not only treasured but used; types cast therefrom being employed for the composition of books and other printed matter.\"\n\nIt’s essentially the inheritance of the will of John Fell, D.D. who died on 10 July 1686, aged 61, Bishop of Oxford and Dean of Christ Church. Since 1668 he spent his life creating a ‘learned press’ in Oxford, endowed with invaluable equipment, setting a high standard for the future of his publishing.\n\nHe wrote: \"The foundation of all successe must be layd in doing things well, and I am sure that will not be don with English letters\" (to Jenkins, 2 Dec. 1672). So he collectected types available in the foreign market: mainly France, Holland and Germany. Fell decided to develop types in its own ‘workhouse’ too.\n\nPeter De Walpergen became his personal type-founder. Says Harry Carter in “THE FELL TYPES. What has been done in and about them” (Oxford University Press, New York, 1968): \"He was born at Frankfurt am Main, descended from a Protestant refugee from Antwerp. He was engaged by the Dutch East India Company in 1671 to work as a type-founder and printer in Java. The comparative crudity of his letter design makes it seems unlikely that he had been trained to cut punches.\"\n\nJohn Fell entrusted him with the cut of the larger bodies: Great Primer Roman and Italic; Double Pica Roman and Italic; French Canon Roman and Italic; Three Lines Pica Roman. De Walpergen cut other types and letters for existing types to be harmonized with the larger bodies. Commented Morison: \"The design of these large Fell Types is difficult to characterize and impossible wholly to approve. It has some affinity with the Dutch work of the second half of the seventeenth century, especially with the bigger size of type shown in the Widow Elsevier’s specimen-sheet of types attributed to Christoffel van Dyck; but De Walpergen went much further in the contrasting weight of thick and thin strokes and his design has crudities about it of which Van Dyck would not have been capable.\"\n\nIn 1686 John Fell died. In his “will” he bequeathed the entire collection of type to the University of Oxford. Remembers Morison: \"This entire collection of ‘founding Materialls of Punchions Matrices Moulds’ was ‘got together’ by John Fell ‘and others at great expense’. Fell’s instructions that they ‘be carefully kept together’ by his executors were duly observed. The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford honourably played their part in sustaining the interests of ‘learning and printing’ and thus the collection was not dissipated but manteined entire.\""

Used for the Georgian language of Georgia, and other Kartvelian languages. Since 430 CE, the Georgian language used an inscriptional form (Asomtavruli), which evolved into a manuscript form (Nuskhuri). These are categorized as Khutsuri (ecclesiastical): Asomtavruli is uppercase, Nuskhuri is lowercase. Khutsuri is still used for liturgical purposes, but was replaced by a new case-less form (Mkhedruli) used for nearly all modern Georgian writing. In the 1950s, Akaki Shanidze attempted to add Asomtavruli as uppercase and use Mkhedruli for lowercase, but the effort did not succeed.

    "description": "STANLEY MORISON, in his “THE ROMAN ITALIC & BLACK LETTER bequeathed to the University of Oxford by Dr. JOHN FELL” (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1951), began this way the description of the FELL TYPES: \"The Oxford Printing house holds the oldest punches and matrices surviving in England, material not only treasured but used; types cast therefrom being employed for the composition of books and other printed matter.\"\n\nIt’s essentially the inheritance of the will of John Fell, D.D. who died on 10 July 1686, aged 61, Bishop of Oxford and Dean of Christ Church. Since 1668 he spent his life creating a ‘learned press’ in Oxford, endowed with invaluable equipment, setting a high standard for the future of his publishing.\n\nHe wrote: \"The foundation of all successe must be layd in doing things well, and I am sure that will not be don with English letters\" (to Jenkins, 2 Dec. 1672). So he collectected types available in the foreign market: mainly France, Holland and Germany. Fell decided to develop types in its own ‘workhouse’ too.\n\nPeter De Walpergen became his personal type-founder. Says Harry Carter in “THE FELL TYPES. What has been done in and about them” (Oxford University Press, New York, 1968): \"He was born at Frankfurt am Main, descended from a Protestant refugee from Antwerp. He was engaged by the Dutch East India Company in 1671 to work as a type-founder and printer in Java. The comparative crudity of his letter design makes it seems unlikely that he had been trained to cut punches.\"\n\nJohn Fell entrusted him with the cut of the larger bodies: Great Primer Roman and Italic; Double Pica Roman and Italic; French Canon Roman and Italic; Three Lines Pica Roman. De Walpergen cut other types and letters for existing types to be harmonized with the larger bodies. Commented Morison: \"The design of these large Fell Types is difficult to characterize and impossible wholly to approve. It has some affinity with the Dutch work of the second half of the seventeenth century, especially with the bigger size of type shown in the Widow Elsevier’s specimen-sheet of types attributed to Christoffel van Dyck; but De Walpergen went much further in the contrasting weight of thick and thin strokes and his design has crudities about it of which Van Dyck would not have been capable.\"\n\nIn 1686 John Fell died. In his “will” he bequeathed the entire collection of type to the University of Oxford. Remembers Morison: \"This entire collection of ‘founding Materialls of Punchions Matrices Moulds’ was ‘got together’ by John Fell ‘and others at great expense’. Fell’s instructions that they ‘be carefully kept together’ by his executors were duly observed. The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford honourably played their part in sustaining the interests of ‘learning and printing’ and thus the collection was not dissipated but manteined entire.\""

    "description": "Atkinson Hyperlegible Next, a refined version of Atkinson Hyperlegible, improves on the original in every way. It features new weights, improved kerning, refined curves, added symbols, and additional language support.\n\nNamed after the founder of the Braille Institute, Atkinson Hyperlegible Next has been developed specifically to increase legibility for readers with low vision, and to improve reading comprehension.\n\nHaving a traditional grotesque sans-serif at its core, it departs from tradition to incorporate unambiguous, distinctive elements—and at times, unexpected forms—always with the goal of increasing character recognition and ultimately improving reading.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/atkinson-hyperlegible-next.\n\n \nFrom Rebranding to Readability with Atkinson Hyperlegible\nlink\nDistinct and modern, the Atkinson Hyperlegible typeface aims to deliver both legibility and readability\nlink\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), at least 2.2 billion people have a vision impairment. Major financial burdens can occur when people can’t read fluently or work to their full potential. For example, the WHO estimates that “losses associated with vision impairment from uncorrected myopia and presbyopia alone were estimated to be US$ 244 billion and US$ 25.4 billion, respectively.” Typeface design can help.\n\nWhen Braille Institute hired Applied Design Works to create a new brand identity and branding strategy to coincide with their 2019 centennial anniversary, the firm looked for a beautiful and functional font specifically designed for improved legibility and readability. Brad Scott and Elliott Scott of Applied Design Works were concerned about typefaces that look a little like old ransom notes, where each letter and number were dramatically different from each other. They wondered if, despite designers’ intentions, these typefaces could actually be more difficult to read for some people. They decided that no existing typeface met their legibility, readability, and branding goals. So they endeavored to create a new typeface called Atkinson Hyperlegible, named after the organization’s founder J. Robert Atkinson. The work would go on to be recognized with a 2019 Fast Company ‘Innovation by Design’ Award."

    "description": "UnifrakturCook is a blackletter font. It is based on Peter Wiegel’s font Koch fette deutsche Schrift which is in turn based on a 1910 typeface by Rudolf Koch. While the glyph design of Peter Wiegel’s font has hardly been changed at all, UnifrakturCook uses smart font technologies for displaying the font’s ligatures (OpenType, Apple Advanced Typography and SIL Graphite). An experimental feature is the distinction of good blackletter typography between required ligatures ‹ch, ck, ſt, tz› that must be kept when letterspacing is increased, and regular ligatures (for instance, ‹fi, fl›) that are broken up when letterspacing is increased.\n\nUsing the ligatures: Whenever you type a sequence such as ‹tz›, it will automatically be displayed as a ligature. When you want to oppress a ligature, for instance in the German word «Zeitzone» ‘time zone’ that should have no tz-ligature, then you put a zero width non-joiner between the ‹t› and the ‹z› or, alternatively, you write «Zeit&zwnj;zone» in the HTML code. Unfortunately, this will only work on a browser that is capable of displaying ligatures.\n\nOf course, UnifrakturMaguntia provides the character ‹ſ› (U+017F LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S)!\n\nUnifrakturCook is optimized for @font-face linking on the internet by combining standards compliance with a permissive license.\n\nUnifrakturCook has first been published in 2010 at UnifrakturCook. It has been edited with FontForge, the libre outline font editor. OpenType features have been added with FontForge directly. AAT features have been added with ftxenhancer of the Apple Font Tools. Graphite has been added with the Graphite Compiler. For more information about AAT and Graphite, you may want to check out the Free Tengwar Font Project: Adding Graphite and AAT to a font."

    "description": "STANLEY MORISON, in his “THE ROMAN ITALIC & BLACK LETTER bequeathed to the University of Oxford by Dr. JOHN FELL” (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1951), began this way the description of the FELL TYPES: \"The Oxford Printing house holds the oldest punches and matrices surviving in England, material not only treasured but used; types cast therefrom being employed for the composition of books and other printed matter.\"\n\nIt’s essentially the inheritance of the will of John Fell, D.D. who died on 10 July 1686, aged 61, Bishop of Oxford and Dean of Christ Church. Since 1668 he spent his life creating a ‘learned press’ in Oxford, endowed with invaluable equipment, setting a high standard for the future of his publishing.\n\nHe wrote: \"The foundation of all successe must be layd in doing things well, and I am sure that will not be don with English letters\" (to Jenkins, 2 Dec. 1672). So he collectected types available in the foreign market: mainly France, Holland and Germany. Fell decided to develop types in its own ‘workhouse’ too.\n\nPeter De Walpergen became his personal type-founder. Says Harry Carter in “THE FELL TYPES. What has been done in and about them” (Oxford University Press, New York, 1968): \"He was born at Frankfurt am Main, descended from a Protestant refugee from Antwerp. He was engaged by the Dutch East India Company in 1671 to work as a type-founder and printer in Java. The comparative crudity of his letter design makes it seems unlikely that he had been trained to cut punches.\"\n\nJohn Fell entrusted him with the cut of the larger bodies: Great Primer Roman and Italic; Double Pica Roman and Italic; French Canon Roman and Italic; Three Lines Pica Roman. De Walpergen cut other types and letters for existing types to be harmonized with the larger bodies. Commented Morison: \"The design of these large Fell Types is difficult to characterize and impossible wholly to approve. It has some affinity with the Dutch work of the second half of the seventeenth century, especially with the bigger size of type shown in the Widow Elsevier’s specimen-sheet of types attributed to Christoffel van Dyck; but De Walpergen went much further in the contrasting weight of thick and thin strokes and his design has crudities about it of which Van Dyck would not have been capable.\"\n\nIn 1686 John Fell died. In his “will” he bequeathed the entire collection of type to the University of Oxford. Remembers Morison: \"This entire collection of ‘founding Materialls of Punchions Matrices Moulds’ was ‘got together’ by John Fell ‘and others at great expense’. Fell’s instructions that they ‘be carefully kept together’ by his executors were duly observed. The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford honourably played their part in sustaining the interests of ‘learning and printing’ and thus the collection was not dissipated but manteined entire.\""

    "description": "Anek, as the meaning of the word suggests, is an exercise in multiplicity — multiple scripts designed in multiple weights and widths by multiple designers. A well-informed, conscientious and refreshing interpretation of India’s letter traditions, this family offers a versatile system that can meet the demands of a wide range of applications.\n\nIts expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep structures compact for that graphic texture. On the wide end of the spectrum, the extra legroom lets each letter yawn and stretch into their message. But it is in the boldest weights that Anek comes alive. Sharp terminals and tapered joineries sparkle amidst regimented forms, making this ideal for setting titillating headlines or that magnetic word-mark.\n\nAnek comes in ten scripts: Bangla, Devanagari, Kannada, Latin, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu. The shared aesthetics of this type-family are drawn from a collaboratively decided pool of visual features. At the same time, each script amalgamates influences from its own typographic culture as well as the perspectives of individual designers.\n\nThis project is designed, engineered and maintained by Ek Type; a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces. Contributors of this project are: Maithili Shingre (Anek Malayalam, Anek Kannada), Yesha Goshar (Anek Latin, Anek Odia), Kailash Malviya (Anek Devanagari), Aadarsh Rajan (Anek Tamil), Sulekha Rajkumar (Anek Bangla), Vaishnavi Murthy (Anek Kannada), Omkar Bhoir (Anek Telugu), Mrunmayee Ghaisas (Anek Gujarati), Mahesh Sahu (Anek Odia), and Sarang Kulkarni (Anek Gurmukhi). Project management and design assistance by Noopur Datye, and Font engineering and design assistance by Girish Dalvi.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/EkType/Anek\n\nMultiple scripts for multilingual India\nlink\nThe award-winning Anek variable font\nlink\nThe nine scripts have base characters in the center, with vowel signs and conjuncts that come above, below or next to them.\n\nThe Anek multi-script typeface for 9 Indian languages and Latin was made through a collaboration of 12 type designers working across 8 cities in India.\n\nHow did Ek Type win two type design awards (the TDC Certificate of Typographic Excellence and the D&AD Graphite Pencil) for their Anek multi-script typeface?\n\nThere were two key factors to their success:\n\nTeamwork: The team of 12 collaborated democratically.\nEquality: Giving equal value to each of the nine Indian writing systems (scripts) and Latin, while maintaining both common visual features and script-specific characteristics.\nTeamwork during lockdown\nlink\n\nGetting 12 people to collaborate while speaking in three languages (English, Hindi, and Marathi) and spread out in eight different Indian cities (Mumbai, Pune, Kalyan, Hinganghat, Baroda, Bengaluru, Bharampur, and Pali) is not an easy task.\n\nEk Type established a collaboration structure that fostered teamwork, while also giving designers the liberty to be creative.\n\nThe team consisted of Maithili Shingre, Yesha Goshar, Kailash Malviya, Aadarsh Rajan, Sulekha Rajkumar, Vaishnavi Murthy, Omkar Bhoir, Mrunmayee Ghaisas, Mahesh Sahu, Sarang Kulkarni, Noopur Datye, and Girish Dalvi.\n\nTen people focused on one script each, while the other two members worked on font engineering and project management. The designers focused on the script that was most familiar to them.\n\nVia three- to four-hour weekly video calls, team members annotated drawings with emojis, arrows, text, and other marks in their video conference platform. In between calls, the team collaborated online. The team made design decisions based on majority or unanimous votes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, most of the team had worked together at the Ek Type studio in Mumbai. Remote work created some unforeseen benefits. “Everyone had the time to venture in different directions, not getting colored by what the others were doing,” said Noopur Datye, co-founder and type designer at Ek Type.\n\nTo learn more, read Multilingual scripts for multilingual India."

    "description": "Gulzar is a contemporary Urdu Nasta’liq typeface – and its Latin counterpart – designed and developed through a collaboration by Borna Izadpanah (Principal Designer and Project Leader), Simon Cozens (Font Engineering), Alice Savoie (Designer, Gulzar Latin), Fiona Ross (Consultant, Gulzar Urdu), Amir Mahdi Moslehi (Calligraphic adviser, Gulzar Urdu) and Martin Dodds (Consultant, Gulzar Urdu). This typeface was designed to provide an effective textual communication tool primarily for Urdu readers on digital platforms and in print. In Gulzar, the aim has been to produce a typeface which is legible at text sizes and suitable for sustained reading. The first phase of this project involved conducting research into the history of Urdu digital typefaces from the early 1980s. The design of Gulzar was inspired by carefully collected specimens of Urdu calligraphy and lettering which were closely studied to achieve an accurate representation of the Urdu flavour of the Nasta’liq style.\n\nOnce the Nasta’liq design was firmly established, a proposal was made for a Latin counterpart that took inspiration from two eminent humanistic references: the versatile and sturdy proportions of Robert Granjon’s types, coupled with the sharp and distinctive feel of Hendrik van den Keere’s work. The Latin letterforms thus feature some subtle references to their calligraphic roots and echo the contrast present in the Nasta’liq, while remaining embedded in their classical typographic proportions.\n\nGulzar is not the first OpenType Nasta’liq typeface, but it is the first Nasta’liq type for which an original Latin counterpart was designed. It covers all the required transliterations characters to transcribe Arabic, Persian and Urdu languages.\n\nYou can read more about the inspiration, design, and engineering of Gulzar at gulzarfont.org.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/Gulzar/.\n\nGulzar: Expanding the variety of Urdu Nasta'liq options\n\nMaking of Gulzar\nlink\n\nTo give Urdu speakers more typeface choices, in July 2022, Google Fonts added Gulzar, a new Nasta'liq Urdu typeface.\n\n1. Gulzar Nasta'liq\n2. Gulzar Latin\n\n\"All human beings are born free and equal in terms of rights and dignity.\" In Urdu (Gulzar Nasta'liq) and transliterated in Latin (Gulzar Latin).\n\nSimon Cozens, Dr. Borna Izadpanah, and Dr. Fiona Ross conducted their own research and consulted with Urdu language specialists in Pakistan and the United Kingdom to create the Gulzar Urdu Nasta'liq typeface project. Gulzar means \"flower meadow\" in Urdu.\n\nIzadpanah is a native Persian speaker from Tehran, Iran. He learned Nasta'liq as a model for Persian handwriting in primary school.\n\n\"Designing a digital Nasta'liq typeface was my long-held dream,\" Izadpanah stated. As the principal Gulzar designer, he conducted the preliminary research and drew the glyphs.\n\nRoss was familiar with the Urdu language and type design from her language studies and earlier work on two Nasta'liq typefaces, Sheeraz and Qalmi, for which Linotype acquired a patent.\n\nTo make a modern digital font based on the Urdu flavor of the Nasta'liq style, Izadpanah studied the proportions, stroke modulation, and character features in calligraphy manuals and a collection of lettering specimens\n\nTo learn more, visit \"Gulzar: Expanding the variety of Urdu Nasta'liq options\" (English, Urdu) and \"Why are there so few Urdu fonts?\" (English, Urdu)."

    "description": "Tillana is a refreshingly informal family of typefaces for Devanagari and Latin. The fonts were first published by the Indian Type Foundry as an open source project in 2014. Coming in at 1,021 glyphs per weight, Tillana has all of the characters necessary to set a variety of European languages, as well as Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, and more. The Tillana family includes five styles, which range in weight from Regular through Extra Bold. Tillana’s Latin do not connect; this part of the family is a non-joining script type. The Devanagari part is one of the few “true cursive” designs currently available for the script.\n\nCharacters from both writing systems appear as if they were fluidly handwritten, particularly the Devanagari. Tillana’s letterforms are slanted at a 10 degree angle. The strokes are show visible contrast, and the dynamic counter forms are one of the design’s most prominent features. The forms involve many loops and hooks and most of the knots are loops rather than closed, black forms. All vertical strokes in both scripts have swelling at their tops and bottoms, and the Devanagari characters’ central vertical strokes almost always break through the headline. Handwriting artefacts are present in the Latin letters, too, such as hook on the descender of the lowercase q.\n\nTillana’s Devanagari base character height falls vertically between the Latin upper and lowercase letter heights. The Latin characters have a small x-height and long ascenders and descenders. Lipi Raval designed the Devanagari components of Tillana, and worked together with Jonny Pinhorn on the Latin.\n\nThis project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type foundry based in Ahmedabad, Gujurat, India, who design contemporary Indian typeface families.

    "description": "Cantora ('Singer' in Spanish) is a friendly semi formal, semi condensed, semi sans serif. It has reminiscences of hand lettering, mixing straight and bowed stems, and natural curves.\n\nIt was born as an experiment in drawing from the outside to the inside (drawing the space surrounding the letters first, instead of drawing the letters themselves) in trying to apply the ideas and methods of Michael Harvey and Evert Bloemsma to my own glyphs construction.\n\nIn 0ctober 2022 naming inconcistencies between the font file and the API were fixed, users maybe cautious with using this update as the font name now aligns with the family name displayed by the API: Cantora One (instead of CantoraOne).\n\nAlthough Cantora is a sans, the lowercase letters have serif proportions. It's perfect for headlines (H1, H2, H3) in sizes larger than 20px."

While weights, widths and optical sizes were carefully crafted to work well in an Australian classroom environment, they are just as comfortable to read and work with in the home environment.\n\nEach Australian state teaches different handwriting styles in lower primary school (although some states do share the same style). There are essentially three stages involved with each state's styles:\n\nThe foundational stage involves learning basic letter formation.\nThe transitional stage adds joining ligatures to some letters.\nThe cursive stage joins almost all letters (with some exceptions).\n\nThe NSW ACT School Fonts include both:\n\nNew South Wales Foundation Print - a simple sloped print for early primary school.\nNew South Wales Foundation Cursive - transitional joining letter alternates (pre-cursive stage).\nStudents in New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory learn Foundation Print from years 1 to 2 and Beginner Cursive from year 3.\n\nGoogle Workspace users are provided standard versions online, however they may download or build the complete OpenType versions from GitHub for local installations. To download the full version, or to contribute, see github.com/MezMerrit/AU-School-Handwriting-Fonts.\n\nThe handwriting fonts that help Australian students learn how to read and write are now available in Google Workspace\nlink\n\nGoogle for Education Australia and Google Fonts partnered to make Foundation Fonts for Australian Schools available on Google Workspace, including Google Workspace for Education. The fonts are also available for download from the Google Fonts website.\n\nAustralian teachers are required to use state-mandated handwriting styles to teach reading and writing to school children from ages four to nine. Designed by Tina and Corey Anderson, the five Foundation Fonts exemplify proper handwriting for English and other languages using the Latin writing system, and include common math symbols. The regular weight of each font imitates the pencil thickness of handwriting, making the fonts easy for students to recognize as they learn how to write letter shapes.\n\nThe availability of these fonts on Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides is also important for the adoption of Chromebooks and Google Workspace for Education in Australian schools.\n\nTo read more, visit The handwriting fonts that help Australian students learn how to read and write are now available in Google Workspace"

    "description": "Półtawski Nowy is a digitisation project the Antykwa Półtawskiego typeface. A key aspect of the design of the digital version of the typeface from 1928 was the approach to the issue of developing the shape of characters from sources. Historical research was carried out in parallel with the preparation of the computer version, which allowed to learn about the unique story of this most recognizable Polish font design. The Półtawski Nowy type family is intended for typesetting in sizes from 10 to 18 pt. The project is implemented thanks to the support of the Digital Culture 2020 program of the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage.\n\nIn the Półtawski Nowy digitisation, the source of the study were scans of a type specimen book from the Idźkowski i S-ka foundry, a set of drawings, punch patterns and punches made by Monotype in Salfords, Great Britain in 1934-1955. They were made available by the Type Archive London. Thanks to the standardization of characters and the balancing of the typographic rhythm, in the digital version, the typeface retains its ornamental character, while working well in smaller text sizes. The basic character set available in the sources has been extended with further variants of diacritics, small caps, subscript and superscript, variants of numbers (tabular, proportional, nautical) and a set of OpenType features.\n\nTo contribute see github.com/kosmynkab/Poltawski-Nowy"

The result is a neutral yet friendly Grotesque style typeface that balances design with the engineered details that make Plex distinctly IBM. The family includes a Sans, Sans Condensed, Mono, and Serif and has excellent legibility in print, web, and mobile interfaces.\n\nPlex’s three designs work well independently and even better together. Use the Sans as a contemporary compadre, the Serif for editorial storytelling, or the Mono to show code snippets. The unexpectedly expressive nature of the italics gives you even more options for your designs.

At that point Google Fonts had fewer than 10 Japanese families, most of which were basic Mincho (serif) and gothic (sans) designs. Since then the collection of Japanese fonts within the library has grown, now with 38 font families from 18 designers, in a variety of styles – from formal text types to fun display fonts. All these Japanese fonts are now live on Google Fonts for anyone to test out and use in any project.\n\nThe Zen Fonts collection is the largest set of Japanese fonts on Google Fonts\nlink\n\nAs part of this larger effort to expand Japanese offerings, Google Fonts collaborated with type designer Yoshimichi Ohira to open his prestigious collection of Zen Fonts typefaces to the public. With 23 Japanese and three Latin fonts in various styles of mincho (serif), gothic (sans serif), maru (rounded), and display styles, the Zen Fonts collection is now the largest set of Japanese fonts in Google Fonts’ expansive library, and is also available in Adobe Fonts.

I first spotted it in an architecture book at my college's library while doing homework.\n\nDorsa is a modern interpretation of Empire with some personal details. When I start sketching I knew it would be a little less condensed than the original Empire because I wanted it to be used for use in titles, and combined with positive letter spacing it gives an elegant look to text. Although the original hasn't got a lowercase, I studied a lot of skyline typefaces and drew a fully original lowercase.\n\nI started with lowercase “o”, which isn't completely geometric, it is expanded to the outside, keeping the same whitespace through all weights. And this repeats all over the typeface, because the construction of all the characters was modular, based on that “o”; the “f” is designed to not meet any of the diacritics; and uppercase “A” has a traditional form, because I think this is more legible."

    "description": "The Foundation Fonts for Australian Schools collection is a set of handwriting fonts designed specifically to meet Australian Education standards. While weights, widths and optical sizes were carefully crafted to work well in an Australian classroom environment, they are just as comfortable to read and work with in the home environment.\n\nEach Australian state teaches different handwriting styles in lower primary school (although some states do share the same style). There are essentially three stages involved with each state's styles:\n\nThe foundational stage involves learning basic letter formation.\nThe transitional stage adds joining ligatures to some letters.\nThe cursive stage joins almost all letters (with some exceptions).\n\nThe TAS School Fonts include:\n\nTasmania Beginners Alphabet - a simple sloped print for early primary school.\nStudents in Tasmania learn the Beginners Alphabet from years 1 and 2, moving on to Pre-Cursive from year 3.\n\nGoogle Workspace users are provided standard versions online, however they may download or build the complete OpenType versions from GitHub for local installations. To download the full version, or to contribute, see github.com/MezMerrit/AU-School-Handwriting-Fonts.\n\nThe handwriting fonts that help Australian students learn how to read and write are now available in Google Workspace\nlink\n\nGoogle for Education Australia and Google Fonts partnered to make Foundation Fonts for Australian Schools available on Google Workspace, including Google Workspace for Education. The fonts are also available for download from the Google Fonts website.\n\nAustralian teachers are required to use state-mandated handwriting styles to teach reading and writing to school children from ages four to nine. Designed by Tina and Corey Anderson, the five Foundation Fonts exemplify proper handwriting for English and other languages using the Latin writing system, and include common math symbols. The regular weight of each font imitates the pencil thickness of handwriting, making the fonts easy for students to recognize as they learn how to write letter shapes.\n\nThe availability of these fonts on Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides is also important for the adoption of Chromebooks and Google Workspace for Education in Australian schools.\n\nTo read more, visit The handwriting fonts that help Australian students learn how to read and write are now available in Google Workspace"

    "description": "Tilt is a family of type inspired by the dimensional lettering found in storefront signage. It’s comprised of three related variable font styles that you might find in a shop window — Tilt Neon, Tilt Prism, and Tilt Warp.\n\nAll three are based around the same letter model of a sign painter’s geometric sans serif, similar to the typefaces Futura or Avant Garde, but with the kinds of details you might expect to see when the letter is built up with a brush.\n\nThe three styles are designed and built as variable fonts. They allow users to rotate the orientation of their glyphs with “Rotation in X” and “Rotation in Y” axes. The rotation is limited to ±45° so that the letterforms never rotate past a readable range.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/Tilt-Fonts.\n\nThe most common axes used in variable fonts are Italic, Optical Size, Slant, Weight, and Width. And while you can sometimes get creative at the extremes of these axes, they're more often used to finesse type. For example, with Weight, you don't have to settle on what the type designer designated as the Bold style, you can tweak it to be a bit lighter or heavier so it's perfect for you.\n\nVariable fonts also open up many possibilities for creative expression! And Google Fonts is adding a bunch of fonts to your palette with new axes to get your juices flowing.\n\nFirst up are the Tilt fonts by Andy Clymer, Tilt Neon, Tilt Prism, and Tilt Warp:\nlink\n\nInitially sparked by the experience of seeing a neon sign from the side, Clymer was inspired to create fonts that allow the orientation of their glyphs to be rotated horizontally and vertically. \"With variable fonts, I thought it was kind of amazing how the physical form of a common sans-serif could inadvertently blend into something that looked like graffiti lettering,\" says Clymer.\n\nAll three fonts are takes on dimensional storefront signage and are controlled by Rotation in X (HROT), and Rotation in Y (VROT) variable axes. The rotation is limited to ±45° so that the letterforms are always within a readable range.\n\nTo learn more, visit:\n\nGet ready for a windfall of new axes, starting with Tilt Neon, Tilt Prism, and Tilt Warp\nTilt minisite"

    "description": "In the absence of a unified national approach, elementary education in the United States is supported by several private companies that espouse different approaches to teaching handwriting. According to American handwriting expert Kate Gladstone, it is difficult to confidently determine which handwriting models are most commonly taught in the country, but among the most widespread are Zaner-Bloser and D’Nealian, both following a traditional style, and Handwriting Without Tears. Two other programs featuring modern cursive models — Getty-Dubay and Barchowsky Fluent Hand — are rapidly gaining interest as writing models not only for children but also for adults seeking to improve their handwriting.\n\nPlaywrite USA Traditional is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite US Trad Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite USA Traditional characteristics\nlink\n\nThis style follows the traditional American style of Zaner-Bloser and D'Nealian, featuring a slanted continuous cursive. Capital letters vary in appearance, with some like 'I', 'H', and 'G' being more decorative, and others such as 'A', 'N', and 'M' maintaining a cursive style. The construction of the letters appears fast and is complex in certain characters. Ascenders and descenders include loops to facilitate continuous writing, with mirrored loops in 'p' and 'q' enhancing the flow. Consistent with other English-speaking models, the entry strokes for 'v' and 'w' are distinctly different.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite USA Traditional appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘US’ and a the ‘Trad’ abbreviation, Playwrite US Trad. It features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in the United States of America, see primarium.info/countries/united-states-of-america.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer. Navigate to where you saved the font file and double-click it to open. Click the \"Install\" button at the top of the font preview window. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nmacOS: After downloading the font file to your Mac, right-click it in Finder and select \"Open With\" > \"Font Book\". Then, click \"Install Font\" in the font preview window that pops up. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nHow to use the fonts in apps?\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually activated.\n\nNote: This font family doesn't include Bold or Italic styles, so please avoid applying them in font editors. If you use the common 'B' and 'I' buttons, you will automatically generate low-quality styles.\n\nGoogle Docs and Slides: From the font selector drop-down, go to \"More Fonts\" and search for the desired font name, in this case, \"Playwrite USA Trad\", and click OK. If some text is already selected, the font choice will apply.\n\nMicrosoft Word: Go to Format in the Menu bar, select Font, and then the Advanced tab. Activate \"Contextual Alternates\" and \"Kerning for fonts below\" to apply these settings to all text sizes.\n\nLibreOffice: In macOS, to select the different styles, go to Format in the Menu bar, select Character, and use the Typeface menu.\n\nAdobe InDesign: Open the Paragraph Panel and select Adobe \"World-Ready Paragraph Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Illustrator: Navigate to Preferences > Type, check the \"Show Indic Options\" box, and close preferences. Then open the Paragraph Panel and select \"Middle Eastern Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Photoshop: Access the Paragraph Panel, then choose \"World-Ready Layout\" from the contextual menu.\n\nThe above instructions are also available in PDF format here."

It attempts to collect, synthesize, and lovingly evoke the identity and spirit of the region in which the original forms were encountered, while acknowledging my own relationship to and presence in the place and the design.\n\nThe primary characteristics that define Girassol include its condensed proportions, moderate contrast following the expansion model, a thorny, decorative serif construction that pierces the baseline and cap height, and playful flourishes that mimic the decoration possible in hand-painted signage.\n\nNumerous discretionary ligatures play on the typeface's angular and thorny construction to evoke a sense of improvisation in the signs on which the forms are based.\n\nThe smallcaps are the result of my effort to capture the secondary style found in the Carcavelos signs. My approach to the smallcaps lead to a set of letters that perfectly complements the main caps but which simultaneously becomes softer and more gentle because of its more square proportion.\n\nGirassol feels at home set in large, striking titles and smaller graphical vignettes.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/liamspradlin/Girassol-Display."

    "description": "This font was developed by the Documenting Judeo-Spanish Project.\n\nDocumenting Judeo-Spanish is a digital humanities project that began in 2019 under the leadership of Dr. Bryan Kirschen. Recalling his initial fascination with Solitreo and the limited resources available to learn this script, Dr. Kirschen decided to focus this project on the cursive variety that was once common to speakers of Judeo-Spanish around the world. A nearly-extinct alphabet to an endangered language, this style of writing can be found in documents ranging from journal entries and ledgers to personal correspondence and community minutes. Many of these very documents are sitting in basements and attics today and, to the untrained eye, are mistaken for Hebrew.\n\nJudeo-Spanish (Ladino) refers to the variety of Spanish that developed among Jewish populations who were expelled from Spain in 1492 and subsequently settled throughout Turkey and the Balkans, then of the Ottoman Empire. These Jews, known as Sephardim, preserved many features of Medieval (varieties of) Spanish, while incorporating linguistic elements from the languages spoken in their surroundings, including: Turkish, Greek, Serbo-Croatian, French, Italian, and Arabic. As a Jewish language, the Spanish of the Sephardim has always been in contact with Hebrew. And while Judeo-Spanish may sound like other Romance languages, in writing, it would have traditionally appeared more similar to a Semitic language.\n\nSolitreo refers to the Hebrew-based cursive script once used by Sephardim; it is the cursive variety of the Rashi alphabet. Solitreo, or Soletreo, is derived from Galician/Portuguese, meaning ‘to spell.’ For many Sephardim, Solitreo was simply known as ganchos, meaning ‘hooks,’ due to the ligatures that form between letters. This style of writing is distinct from the Ashkenazi-based alphabet used for cursive Hebrew today, making documents in Solitreo undecipherable to the untrained eye. A similar style of writing can also be found in documents written in Judeo-Arabic. Today, Solitreo is a relic of the past, as most writers of the language utilize Roman characters.\n\nMost non-Hebrew glyphs in this font were forked from Kalam.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/ladinoprojects/solitreo."

It has a somewhat neutral personality with a touch of soft and smooth curves that add some whimsy. Yaldevi will perform well when used in headlines, subheads and shorter text blocks such as pull quotes. Sinhala glyphs have some peculiarities and experimental shapes that were invented to perform well as a display face while belonging in the formal text typeface category. Make sure you check out all these features before using it.\n\nThe project is led by Mooniak Latin set is designed by Sol Matas. Initial development and release was funded by Google Fonts in 2015. Project sources are hosted and developed on Github and Mooniak welcomes suggestions and contributions to the development."

The font Jacob produced was sold as a »Caractères dans le genre Baskerwille« i.e »Baskerwille alike fonts« — with a w instead of a v.\n\nThe particularity of Jacob’s Baskerwille is that the roman is very close to Baskerville’s typefaces while the italic is closer to Didot’s typefaces. The ANRT workshop aimed to digitize Jacob’s font in order to show his work which moves from transitional to modern styles.\n\nBaskervville was designed by the ANRT students from 2017 (Alexis Faudot, Rémi Forte, Morgane Pierson, Rafael Ribas, Tanguy Vanlaeys and Rosalie Wagner), under the direction of Charles Mazé. Development and production by Rosalie Wagner.\n\nBaskervville SC is the small caps version of Baskervville.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/anrt-type/ANRT-Baskervville"

It combines high quality in readability and legibility while carrying on the stately Japanese Mincho type tradition. BIZ UD Mincho bases its design on one of the typefaces from the Morisawa font library, which has thicker horizontal lines than the traditional Mincho type style. Because most Mincho types have thin horizontal strokes, the style can be difficult to read on some displays or signs and for people with low vision. For the universal design version, dakuten (゛) and handakuten (゜) voicing marks are designed to be more legible, and the letterforms are adjusted to maintain their balance while having a larger face and wider counters.\n\nUD Mincho includes full-width kana. UDPMincho includes proportional-wdith kana.\n\nTo contribute to the project, visit github.com/googlefonts/morisawa-biz-ud-mincho\n\nMorisawa BIZ Universal Design (UD) Japanese fonts added to Google Fonts and Google Workspace\nlink\n\nAs part of our larger effort to make great type accessible in more languages, Google Fonts is pleased to announce that the Japanese type foundry Morisawa has made 2 BIZ Universal Design (UD) font families available on Google Fonts, under the SIL Open Font License. These Gothic and Mincho designs, available in regular and bold weights and proportional and full width styles, are now also available in Google Workspace.\n\n“Having these fonts available in Japan allows Google Education to align with the most widely used fonts in education publishing in Japan,” said Stuart Miller, Head of Marketing for Google Education in Asia Pacific (APAC). “This makes it easier for partners to collaborate with Google Education. It also ensures a more consistent, inclusive, delightful experience for the millions of teachers and students that use Google tools.”\n\nDrawing on extensive end-user evaluation, the BIZ UD typefaces were developed using the principles of universal design (UD) to ensure legibility (the ease of differentiating individual characters) and readability (the ease of reading text overall). BIZ UD fonts are especially suited for conveying text accurately—for example, in educational settings, corporate communication environments, and other places that use ICT.\n\nTo learn more, read Morisawa BIZ Universal Design (UD) Japanese fonts added to Google Fonts and Google Workspace."

The two Kumar fonts may be used together, or entirely on their own.\n\nKumar One Outline is a vertical-contrast design, in which both the downstrokes as well as the left and right-hand sides of each letterform are built up out of two parallel lines and the whites space in-between them. The upstrokes and typeface’s horizontals are just thin, single lines.\n\nKumar One itself fills in all of the thicker empty spaces in the downstrokes/horizontals, offering letterforms that are very dark and full of contrast.\n\nThe Kumar design is made entirely out of straight lines; all elements that would usually be drawn with soft curves are faceted, built up out of several shorter straightened-out elements. Text in either Kumar font shimmers like a jewel; the effect of both fonts is quite decorative.\n\nThe Gujarati and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that the Gujarati base characters are 85% as tall as the Latin uppercase. Text set in the Gujarati script sits nicely alongside the Latin lowercase, too. Kumar’s Gujarati vowel marks are all single-line, rather than double-line. Indeed, Kumar’s Gujarati is a very unique design; there are simply no other options like it currently available!\n\nEach of the Kumar fonts has 870 glyphs, including hundreds of unique Gujarati conjuncts. The Latin component’s character set is an extended one, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western, Central, and Eastern European languages. Parimal Parmar designed Kumar for Indian Type Foundry in 2016.\n\nThe Kumar project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India.

The decorative elements fly all over the place, along with shifting weight and contrast. This lends itself particularly well to animations.\n\nEach glyph has four primary states that be morphed between, and can be considered the most stable and considered forms. Each of these are accessible as instances (styles) in font menus that properly support variable fonts. This offers a quick alternative for accessing the alternate forms, and can be handy if you don’t need all the variety, and in-between states of the full variable font.\n\nKablammo was designed by Vectro Type Foundry and released in 2023.\n\nTo contribute, please see github.com/Vectro-Type-Foundry/kablammo."

The main challenge was to make compatible dialectic elements, especially balancing legibility and formal identity. Almendra was selected to be exhibited at the Bienal Iberoamericana de Diseño in 2010 and was part of the German editorial project Typodarium 2012.\n\nThis is the Small Cap family, and there are sister Regular and Display families."

    "description": "Literacy education in Cuba is notable for its distinctive approach: students are introduced to two different styles of letters from the outset, one for reading and the other for writing. Textbooks feature print-style, typographic letters represented by either geometric or grotesque sans serifs for reading. These styles are consistent across all workbooks and textbooks, with the exception of those focused on writing and calligraphy. For these, a fully-joined, cursive style is used, drawing inspiration from calligraphic models from the United States, notably the Palmer Method, created by Austin Palmer , and the Zaner-Bloser method, developed by Charles Paxton Zaner and his partner Elmer Ward Bloser.\n\nPlaywrite Cuba is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite CU Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Cuba characteristics\nlink\n\nThis style is a very slanted continuous cursive that draws inspiration from the Zaner-Bloser and D'Nealian models. It features cursive uppercase letters, some of which are quite complex, such as 'I', 'J', and 'G'. The lowercase letters have medium-length extenders with loops, present even in letters like 'p' and 'q', and are formed using slow strokes. Notably, this style includes an italic-style 'r' and a 'z' with a flat top and a loop.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Cuba appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘CU’, Playwrite CU, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in Cuba, see primarium.info/countries/cuba.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer. Navigate to where you saved the font file and double-click it to open. Click the \"Install\" button at the top of the font preview window. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nmacOS: After downloading the font file to your Mac, right-click it in Finder and select \"Open With\" > \"Font Book\". Then, click \"Install Font\" in the font preview window that pops up. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nHow to use the fonts in apps?\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually activated.\n\nNote: This font family doesn't include Bold or Italic styles, so please avoid applying them in text editors. If you use the common 'B' and 'I' buttons, you will automatically generate low-quality styles.\n\nGoogle Docs and Slides: From the font selector drop-down, go to \"More Fonts\" and search for the desired font name, in this case, \"Playwrite CU\", and click OK. If some text is already selected, the font choice will apply.\n\nMicrosoft Word: Go to Format in the Menu bar, select Font, and then the Advanced tab. Activate \"Contextual Alternates\" and \"Kerning for fonts below\" to apply these settings to all text sizes.\n\nLibreOffice: In macOS, to select the different styles, go to Format in the Menu bar, select Character, and use the Typeface menu.\n\nAdobe InDesign: Open the Paragraph Panel and select Adobe \"World-Ready Paragraph Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Illustrator: Navigate to Preferences > Type, check the \"Show Indic Options\" box, and close preferences. Then open the Paragraph Panel and select \"Middle Eastern Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Photoshop: Access the Paragraph Panel, then choose \"World-Ready Layout\" from the contextual menu.\n\nThe above instructions are also available in PDF format here."

    "description": "Marko One is a typeface designed for children's literature. The initial idea was to create a typeface-companion for Marko the Sparrow - a cartoon character by illustrator and type designer Zhenya Spizhovyi.\n\nMarko One is simple and smooth, has special inner tension and eye-catchy detailing. The letterforms are based on calligraphy and sketches - this is what makes Marko lively, enchanting, and amiable. Marko One typeface will work best in medium to large sizes and captivating headlines. It is technically optimized for better performance on screen, while carefully adjusted outlines promise good quality in print too."

Learn how changing fonts can change comprehension.\n\nA child struggles to read and understand their homework assignment. An adult re-reads a news article and still doesn’t understand what it’s about. Both readers end up frustrated and feeling like there is something wrong with them. Thankfully there might be a simple answer. Dr. Bonnie Shaver-Troup thinks fonts are part of the problem and the solution to many reading problems.\n\n“We have a global reading crisis and we can change much of it by delivering fonts that are optimized for the visual field and for the individual. The answer is hidden in plain sight. It’s the font,” said Shaver-Troup.\n\nChange the font, change the outcome\nlink\n\nWhile working as an educational therapist in Silicon Valley, Shaver-Troup helped students with dyslexia and other reading problems to learn to read. She experimented by changing the spacing between certain letters in their reading assignments, and found that it improved their reading and comprehension. According to Shaver-Troup, the issue wasn’t in her students’ minds, it was with the letterforms they saw on the screen or paper.\n\n“The majority of the reading problems, including dyslexia, are not cognitive or phonological. They are visual or perceptual. Our testing has a built-in design flaw. We use fonts to deliver text for reading that are too tight for efficient or successful visual processing. Then we get poor results, suggesting the reading issue is phonological or cognitive. If we change the font to the tested optimized font fit, then we change the outcome,” she explained.\n\nTo learn more, read:\nClean and clear: making reading easier with Lexend (English)\nPartnering to change how the world reads (English)\nEine Partnerschaft mit dem Ziel, das Leseerlebnis weltweit zu verändern: Erweiterung von Lexend um verschiedene Schriftstärken (German)"

    "description": "Anek, as the meaning of the word suggests, is an exercise in multiplicity — multiple scripts designed in multiple weights and widths by multiple designers. A well-informed, conscientious and refreshing interpretation of India’s letter traditions, this family offers a versatile system that can meet the demands of a wide range of applications.\n\nIts expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep structures compact for that graphic texture. On the wide end of the spectrum, the extra legroom lets each letter yawn and stretch into their message. But it is in the boldest weights that Anek comes alive. Sharp terminals and tapered joineries sparkle amidst regimented forms, making this ideal for setting titillating headlines or that magnetic word-mark.\n\nAnek comes in ten scripts: Bangla, Devanagari, Kannada, Latin, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu. The shared aesthetics of this type-family are drawn from a collaboratively decided pool of visual features. At the same time, each script amalgamates influences from its own typographic culture as well as the perspectives of individual designers.\n\nThis project is designed, engineered and maintained by Ek Type; a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces. Contributors of this project are: Maithili Shingre (Anek Malayalam, Anek Kannada), Yesha Goshar (Anek Latin, Anek Odia), Kailash Malviya (Anek Devanagari), Aadarsh Rajan (Anek Tamil), Sulekha Rajkumar (Anek Bangla), Vaishnavi Murthy (Anek Kannada), Omkar Bhoir (Anek Telugu), Mrunmayee Ghaisas (Anek Gujarati), Mahesh Sahu (Anek Odia), and Sarang Kulkarni (Anek Gurmukhi). Project management and design assistance by Noopur Datye, and Font engineering and design assistance by Girish Dalvi.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/EkType/Anek\n\nMultiple scripts for multilingual India\nlink\nThe award-winning Anek variable font\nlink\nThe nine scripts have base characters in the center, with vowel signs and conjuncts that come above, below or next to them.\n\nThe Anek multi-script typeface for 9 Indian languages and Latin was made through a collaboration of 12 type designers working across 8 cities in India.\n\nHow did Ek Type win two type design awards (the TDC Certificate of Typographic Excellence and the D&AD Graphite Pencil) for their Anek multi-script typeface?\n\nThere were two key factors to their success:\n\nTeamwork: The team of 12 collaborated democratically.\nEquality: Giving equal value to each of the nine Indian writing systems (scripts) and Latin, while maintaining both common visual features and script-specific characteristics.\nTeamwork during lockdown\nlink\n\nGetting 12 people to collaborate while speaking in three languages (English, Hindi, and Marathi) and spread out in eight different Indian cities (Mumbai, Pune, Kalyan, Hinganghat, Baroda, Bengaluru, Bharampur, and Pali) is not an easy task.\n\nEk Type established a collaboration structure that fostered teamwork, while also giving designers the liberty to be creative.\n\nThe team consisted of Maithili Shingre, Yesha Goshar, Kailash Malviya, Aadarsh Rajan, Sulekha Rajkumar, Vaishnavi Murthy, Omkar Bhoir, Mrunmayee Ghaisas, Mahesh Sahu, Sarang Kulkarni, Noopur Datye, and Girish Dalvi.\n\nTen people focused on one script each, while the other two members worked on font engineering and project management. The designers focused on the script that was most familiar to them.\n\nVia three- to four-hour weekly video calls, team members annotated drawings with emojis, arrows, text, and other marks in their video conference platform. In between calls, the team collaborated online. The team made design decisions based on majority or unanimous votes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, most of the team had worked together at the Ek Type studio in Mumbai. Remote work created some unforeseen benefits. “Everyone had the time to venture in different directions, not getting colored by what the others were doing,” said Noopur Datye, co-founder and type designer at Ek Type.\n\nTo learn more, read Multilingual scripts for multilingual India."

As a new way to achieve variable font, the lighterPhudu gets, the extended it becomes, for people to read it easier compared to other lightweight narrow typefaces.\n\nIn the progress of learning and crafting types, Duong has always thought about what makes a Vietnamese typeface. If we rewind to the past, we can see a Vietnamese lettering style on the billboard stores, when the artists adapted Latin typefaces and then added marks based on their styles. Among those, there were mostly all-caps sans-serif types played as descriptions or the store's names themself. To make a new easy-to-read and easy-to-get typeface, Duong mixed some of the researched letters from the story above. He doesn't want to just revive the types, he wants to improve them to fit the modern-day styles, but still have \"Vietnamese\" souls in them. The typeface was named Phudu (phục dựng) - \"revival\" in Vietnamese, and has a meaning of timeless (quite the opposite of the name when it can be read as \"phù du\" - ephemeral).\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/duongtrtype/DTPhudu"

The typeface’s weight responds to the levels of Arctic sea ice from 1979 to 2019 and predictions for 2050, based on data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center.\n\nCase study on the mini website.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/dancoull/ClimateCrisis.\n\nShow your type melting over time like a glacier with Climate Crisis and its Year axis\nlink\n\nAs mentioned in the recent article about the Tilt family, Google Fonts is adding a bunch of new expressive variable fonts and axes to the library. Check out the latest release, Climate Crisis.\n\nClimate Crisis, with its new variable axis called Year, was commissioned by the Nordic newspaper \"Helsingin Sanomat\" to use in its own editorial and marketing. It visualizes the urgency of climate change by appearing to degrade over time, like each character is a glacier melting away. More than just a metaphor, the font reflects actual data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center to represent the levels of Arctic sea ice from 1979 to 2019. Satellite measuring began in 1979. Predictive data from The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is used to visualize the ice melting through 2050.\n\nThe typeface's designers, Daniel Coull and Eino Korkala included eight masters for the Year axis. (When type designers create a variable font, they need to embed masters at each extreme end of a variable axis, but often they embed multiple masters along the axis in order to give the in-between instances more finesse.) The heaviest weight represents the Arctic sea ice in 1979. The lightest weight represents the IPCC's 2050 forecast, when only 30% of the ice will remain.\n\nTo learn more, read:\n\nShow your type melting over time like a glacier with Climate Crisis and its Year axis.\nClimate Crisis minisite"

    "description": "The Charles Bluemlein Script Collection is an intriguing reminder of the heady days of hand lettering and calligraphy in the United States. From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs.\n\nAlejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein."

    "description": "Anek, as the meaning of the word suggests, is an exercise in multiplicity — multiple scripts designed in multiple weights and widths by multiple designers. A well-informed, conscientious and refreshing interpretation of India’s letter traditions, this family offers a versatile system that can meet the demands of a wide range of applications.\n\nIts expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep structures compact for that graphic texture. On the wide end of the spectrum, the extra legroom lets each letter yawn and stretch into their message. But it is in the boldest weights that Anek comes alive. Sharp terminals and tapered joineries sparkle amidst regimented forms, making this ideal for setting titillating headlines or that magnetic word-mark.\n\nAnek comes in ten scripts: Bangla, Devanagari, Kannada, Latin, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu. The shared aesthetics of this type-family are drawn from a collaboratively decided pool of visual features. At the same time, each script amalgamates influences from its own typographic culture as well as the perspectives of individual designers.\n\nThis project is designed, engineered and maintained by Ek Type; a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces. Contributors of this project are: Maithili Shingre (Anek Malayalam, Anek Kannada), Yesha Goshar (Anek Latin, Anek Odia), Kailash Malviya (Anek Devanagari), Aadarsh Rajan (Anek Tamil), Sulekha Rajkumar (Anek Bangla), Vaishnavi Murthy (Anek Kannada), Omkar Bhoir (Anek Telugu), Mrunmayee Ghaisas (Anek Gujarati), Mahesh Sahu (Anek Odia), and Sarang Kulkarni (Anek Gurmukhi). Project management and design assistance by Noopur Datye, and Font engineering and design assistance by Girish Dalvi.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/EkType/Anek\n\nMultiple scripts for multilingual India\nlink\nThe award-winning Anek variable font\nlink\nThe nine scripts have base characters in the center, with vowel signs and conjuncts that come above, below or next to them.\n\nThe Anek multi-script typeface for 9 Indian languages and Latin was made through a collaboration of 12 type designers working across 8 cities in India.\n\nHow did Ek Type win two type design awards (the TDC Certificate of Typographic Excellence and the D&AD Graphite Pencil) for their Anek multi-script typeface?\n\nThere were two key factors to their success:\n\nTeamwork: The team of 12 collaborated democratically.\nEquality: Giving equal value to each of the nine Indian writing systems (scripts) and Latin, while maintaining both common visual features and script-specific characteristics.\nTeamwork during lockdown\nlink\n\nGetting 12 people to collaborate while speaking in three languages (English, Hindi, and Marathi) and spread out in eight different Indian cities (Mumbai, Pune, Kalyan, Hinganghat, Baroda, Bengaluru, Bharampur, and Pali) is not an easy task.\n\nEk Type established a collaboration structure that fostered teamwork, while also giving designers the liberty to be creative.\n\nThe team consisted of Maithili Shingre, Yesha Goshar, Kailash Malviya, Aadarsh Rajan, Sulekha Rajkumar, Vaishnavi Murthy, Omkar Bhoir, Mrunmayee Ghaisas, Mahesh Sahu, Sarang Kulkarni, Noopur Datye, and Girish Dalvi.\n\nTen people focused on one script each, while the other two members worked on font engineering and project management. The designers focused on the script that was most familiar to them.\n\nVia three- to four-hour weekly video calls, team members annotated drawings with emojis, arrows, text, and other marks in their video conference platform. In between calls, the team collaborated online. The team made design decisions based on majority or unanimous votes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, most of the team had worked together at the Ek Type studio in Mumbai. Remote work created some unforeseen benefits. “Everyone had the time to venture in different directions, not getting colored by what the others were doing,” said Noopur Datye, co-founder and type designer at Ek Type.\n\nTo learn more, read Multilingual scripts for multilingual India."

    "description": "Kumar is a series of matching Open Source display fonts. They each support the Gujarati and Latin scripts. The two Kumar fonts may be used together, or entirely on their own.\n\nKumar One Outline is a vertical-contrast design, in which both the downstrokes as well as the left and right-hand sides of each letterform are built up out of two parallel lines and the whites space in-between them. The upstrokes and typeface’s horizontals are just thin, single lines.\n\nKumar One itself fills in all of the thicker empty spaces in the downstrokes/horizontals, offering letterforms that are very dark and full of contrast.\n\nThe Kumar design is made entirely out of straight lines; all elements that would usually be drawn with soft curves are faceted, built up out of several shorter straightened-out elements. Text in either Kumar font shimmers like a jewel; the effect of both fonts is quite decorative.\n\nThe Gujarati and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that the Gujarati base characters are 85% as tall as the Latin uppercase. Text set in the Gujarati script sits nicely alongside the Latin lowercase, too. Kumar’s Gujarati vowel marks are all single-line, rather than double-line. Indeed, Kumar’s Gujarati is a very unique design; there are simply no other options like it currently available!\n\nEach of the Kumar fonts has 870 glyphs, including hundreds of unique Gujarati conjuncts. The Latin component’s character set is an extended one, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western, Central, and Eastern European languages. Parimal Parmar designed Kumar for Indian Type Foundry in 2016.\n\nThe Kumar project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India.

    "description": "Tiro Devanagari Sanskrit has its origins in a typeface designed for the Murty Classical Library of India book series, so is especially suited to traditional literary publishing but also made with the needs of today’s multiple print and screen media in mind. The Tiro Devanagari design applies a contemporary approach to the traditional styling of 19th and 20th Century metal types exemplified in those of the renowned Nirnaya Sagar Press, and is characterised by broader proportions, more generous counters, and strong diagonal strokes and terminals. The Sanskrit font favours traditional forms of conjuncts. For the Open Font License release, Tiro Devanagari Sanskrit has been extended to support additional characters, including signs for Vedic texts, and features a new italic companion. Each font also includes a Latin subset including diacritics for transcription of Indian languages.\n\nTiro Devanagari Sanskrit was designed by John Hudson and Fiona Ross. The italic was adapted by Paul Hanslow.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TiroTypeworks/Indigo.\n\nModern Tiro Indic collection for classical South Asian texts\nlink\nThe beauty and challenges of bridging the old and the new\nlink\n\nTwo type designers separated by an eight-hour time difference, an ocean, and pandemic travel bans collaborated over video calls and email to make a cohesive set of fonts in 8 South Asian languages. In 2012, Harvard University Press commissioned Fiona Ross and John Hudson, through Tiro Typeworks, to design typefaces for the Murty Classical Library of India book series. The publisher needed to reprint ancient Indian literary, historical, and religious texts, including Vedic and early Sanskrit works. Since these old texts had been printed using traditional letterforms and early Indian typography techniques, the new fonts needed to retain some of the traditional style of the old texts, yet be clear and legible in modern print and digital media.\n\nIn 2019 Google Fonts approached Tiro to make an extended and updated version of the Murty Fonts to be released as open source fonts in the Tiro Indic collection, offering users traditional text styles suitable for a variety of uses.\n\nStudy the classics and language structure\nlink\n\nBefore designing the typefaces, it was important to research classical texts and understand the unique characteristics of the languages.\n\n“We looked at very lovely manuscripts or early Indian printed materials from the 18th or 19th Centuries,” said John Hudson.\n\nTo learn more, read Modern Tiro Indic collection for classical South Asian texts."

Following their lead, Bungee typesets horizontally and vertically, so it is always ready to take your text in a new direction.\n\nBungee’s letterforms were designed to reinforce a sense of verticality. Round characters like O and diagonal characters like A are straight-sided, and letters like L and I gain serifs in order to create vertical words with well-defined left and right edges.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/djrrb/Bungee\n\nThe Bungee family\nlink\n\nGoogle Fonts distributes seven variants of Bungee, including two color fonts:\n\nBungee\nBungee Hairline\nBungee Inline\nBungee Outline\nBungee Shade\nBungee Tint, a COLRv0 font\nBungee Spice, a COLRv1 font\n\nBungee’s downloadable releases also includes special layer fonts (for multicolor typesetting in environments where color fonts are not supported) and rotated fonts (for stacked typesetting in environments where vertical text is not supported).\n\nThe Bungee project is led by David Jonathan Ross, and thanks to support from Google and The Font Bureau, Bungee was released under the SIL Open Font License.\n\nIn 2023–24, Marte Verhaegen and Just van Rossum produced a major revision (v2), which includes an automated build process as well as many enhancements to the vertical features and color fonts."

Due to its unmistakable old Kufic style, it gives a feeling of something old, historical, or Islamic.\n\nThe Arabic component was designed by Khaled Hosny, who combined it with the Latin component by Santiago Orozco. Reem is an Arabic female name that literally means “a white deer,” and is also the name of Khaled's daughter.\n\nThis font uses the COLRv1, CPAL and SVG tables.

    "description": "The latest edition of the national curriculum, published in 2014, requires that at the end of fourth grade, students must “write all the letters, write clearly and understandably.” Handwriting teaching in Iceland happens during grades 1-3 (6-9 years old), and books by the MMS adhere to a progressive system based on simplified modern italic styles.\n\nAccording to this system, students should first be introduced to the lowercase letters of Grunnskrift or the initial model. These are simplified and unconnected letters, slightly slanted and with exit strokes. This should be followed by uppercase letters of the same model. Finally, in the third grade (8-9 years old), students learn Tengiskrift or joined letters.\n\nPlaywrite Ísland is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite IS Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Ísland characteristics\nlink\n\nThis slanted modern cursive handwriting is crafted for high-speed writing and features print-style uppercase letters, with 'M' notably having splain legs. The lowercase letters are inspired by early Italic calligraphies, including the chancery style. Letters that end with a descender do not connect to the subsequent character, making this a semi-connected model. Both 'b' and 'p' feature closed bowls, while 'z' and 'r' are designed with an italic structure, stressing the script’s aesthetic and functional attributes.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Ísland appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘IS’, Playwrite IS, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in Ísland, see primarium.info/countries/iceland.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer. Navigate to where you saved the font file and double-click it to open. Click the \"Install\" button at the top of the font preview window. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nmacOS: After downloading the font file to your Mac, right-click it in Finder and select \"Open With\" > \"Font Book\". Then, click \"Install Font\" in the font preview window that pops up. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nHow to use the fonts in apps?\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually activated.\n\nNote: This font family doesn't include Bold or Italic styles, so please avoid applying them in text editors. If you use the common 'B' and 'I' buttons, you will automatically generate low-quality styles.\n\nGoogle Docs and Slides: From the font selector drop-down, go to \"More Fonts\" and search for the desired font name, in this case, \"Playwrite IS\", and click OK. If some text is already selected, the font choice will apply.\n\nMicrosoft Word: Go to Format in the Menu bar, select Font, and then the Advanced tab. Activate \"Contextual Alternates\" and \"Kerning for fonts below\" to apply these settings to all text sizes.\n\nLibreOffice: In macOS, to select the different styles, go to Format in the Menu bar, select Character, and use the Typeface menu.\n\nAdobe InDesign: Open the Paragraph Panel and select Adobe \"World-Ready Paragraph Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Illustrator: Navigate to Preferences > Type, check the \"Show Indic Options\" box, and close preferences. Then open the Paragraph Panel and select \"Middle Eastern Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Photoshop: Access the Paragraph Panel, then choose \"World-Ready Layout\" from the contextual menu.\n\nThe above instructions are also available in PDF format here."

    "description": "Hedvig is a digital insurance company that is challenging the traditional insurance industry by providing a predictable insurance experience.\n\nThe Hedvig typeface family was created by Kanon Foundry in collaboration with Hedvig’s in-house design department. The typface reflects Hedvig’s brand philosophy “Stuff happens” – embracing all the things that happen in life, without worry or fear.\n\nThe typeface family Hedvig Letters consists of two fonts:\n\n\nHedvig Letters Serif is designed to balance punchy and honest copy with responsibility and comfort.\nHedvig Letters Sans takes the role of the work-horse typeface in Hedvig’s visual toolbox.\n\nThe concept for the typeface was developed by approaching a “non-type-designer” point of view. Optical corrections are usually applied to a typeface to fool the eye that certain shapes are balanced or aligned, when in reality they are not. For this typeface, the imperfections were embraced instead of corrected. The result is a typeface where some letters have a slightly odd, yet characteristic look that effectively communicates Hedvig’s brand and design philosophy.\n\nTo contribute, please see github.com/KanonFoundry/HedvigLetters."

However, in practice, the pixel size is determined by the properties of the yarn in use. Scale is determined by the weight of the yarn as well as the number of pixels that make up the height of each letter. In this collection, the number following the typeface's name indicates the height of the capital letters for that typeface.\n\nThese typefaces were designed with machine knitting in mind, but could be used for hand knitting, needlework, bedazzling, or many other textile crafts.\n\nNote: For Fair Isle knitting, you need to beware of floats and plan accordingly, as always.\n\nEach typeface has a “Regular” and “Charted” version, and some include multiple scales so you can fit type on your knits, no matter the project's size. Check out the charted version Jacquard 12 Charted.\n\nTo contribute, please see github.com/scfried/soft-type-jacquard."

    "description": "Jaini and Jaini Purva (both Devanagari) are typefaces based on the calligraphic style of the Jain Kalpasutra manuscripts, particularly referencing a manuscript from 1503 CE. The manuscript style has several unique features not seen in the commonly observed Balbodh style. These include a disconnected shirorekha with triangular wedges, short upper matras, squarish letters with large kana height, heavy knots, and the integration of lower matras within the kana height. It also contains some letter-shapes that have evolved over time and are not familiar to current readers. In an attempt to revive the distinct calligraphic style for contemporary use, Jaini adapts visual features of the manuscript style to contemporary letter-structures. Jaini and Jaini Purva differ in their treatment of conjuncts; Jaini adheres to contemporary conventions of horizontal conjuncts, whereas Jaini Purva stays true to vertically stacked conjuncts as seen in manuscripts.\n\nWhile Jaini Devanagari references past manuscripts, its Latin companion draws inspiration from a hand-lettering style seen in present-day India. In regions where Devanagari is predominantly used, it is not uncommon to see Latin letterforms drawn with a Devanagari pen angle (which is almost perpendicular to the Latin pen angle) with a subtle hint of a shirorekha. Jaini (Latin) draws inspiration from this street style while visually matching it with the wavy stems and squarish counters of Jaini Devanagari.\n\nJaini Devanagari was designed in 2016 by Girish Dalvi and Maithili Shingre. Jaini Latin was designed in 2023 by Taresh Vohra. This project is led by Ek Type, a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces.\n\nTo contribute to the project, see github.com/EkType/Jaini"

    "description": "IBM Plex® is the corporate typeface for IBM worldwide and an open-source project developed by the IBM Brand & Experience team (BX&D). Plex is an international typeface family designed to capture IBM’s brand spirit and history and to illustrate the unique relationship between mankind and machine—a principal theme for IBM since the turn of the century. The result is a neutral yet friendly Grotesque style typeface that balances design with the engineered details that make Plex distinctly IBM. The family includes a Sans, Sans Condensed, Mono, and Serif and has excellent legibility in print, web, and mobile interfaces.\n\nPlex’s three designs work well independently and even better together. Use the Sans as a contemporary compadre, the Serif for editorial storytelling, or the Mono to show code snippets. The unexpectedly expressive nature of the italics gives you even more options for your designs. Currently, IBM Plex Sans supports Extended Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean and Thai."

From crummy liquor stores to majestic theaters, sometimes signs have nowhere to go but up.\n\nBungee is a font that celebrates urban signs that stack the Latin alphabet, one letter on top of the other, in order to make dramatic use of limited space. Following their lead, Bungee typesets horizontally and vertically, so it is always ready to take your text in a new direction.\n\nBungee’s letterforms were designed to reinforce a sense of verticality. Round characters like O and diagonal characters like A are straight-sided, and letters like L and I gain serifs in order to create vertical words with well-defined left and right edges.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/djrrb/Bungee\n\nThe Bungee family\nlink\n\nGoogle Fonts distributes seven variants of Bungee, including two color fonts:\n\nBungee\nBungee Hairline\nBungee Inline\nBungee Outline\nBungee Shade\nBungee Tint, a COLRv0 font\nBungee Spice, a COLRv1 font\n\nBungee’s downloadable releases also includes special layer fonts (for multicolor typesetting in environments where color fonts are not supported) and rotated fonts (for stacked typesetting in environments where vertical text is not supported).\n\nThe Bungee project is led by David Jonathan Ross, and thanks to support from Google and The Font Bureau, Bungee was released under the SIL Open Font License.\n\nIn 2023–24, Marte Verhaegen and Just van Rossum produced a major revision (v2), which includes an automated build process as well as many enhancements to the vertical features and color fonts."

    "description": "The Charles Bluemlein Script Collection is an intriguing reminder of the heady days of hand lettering and calligraphy in the United States. From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs.\n\nAlejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein."

    "description": "Italy holds an important place in the historical development of handwriting styles. Handwriting produced in the Latin script finds its roots in the models produced during the Italian Renaissance. The most prevalent form of handwriting taught in Italy is an upright cursive style developed in the early to mid-20th century, which, according to handwriting expert Francesco Ascoli, was prescribed in the country’s national guidelines in 1945.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, the decline in the quality of handwriting in Italy caught the attention of the educational community. To rectify this situation, educators and handwriting experts started to explore different ways to improve instruction in primary schools by revamping approaches and resources for traditional handwriting education, or introducing new teaching schemes. The Scrittura Corsiva modern cursive project has gained significant recognition among the latter.\n\nPlaywrite Italia Moderna is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite IT Moderna Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Italia Moderna characteristics\nlink\n\nThis is a fully joined modern cursive, completely upright, with short ascenders and descenders. it has simplified print style capital letters. Identity traits: It has serifs and 'M' has splain legs. Lowercases use descender loops to connect with the next letter in 'f', 'g', 'j' and 'y'. 'p' and 'b' have closed bowls, 'k' is written with two strokes, and 'f' is missing its top loop.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Italia Moderna appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘IT‘ and a the word ‘Moderna‘, Playwrite IT Moderna. It features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info, and to learn more about handwriting education in Italy, see primarium.info/countries/italy.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer. Navigate to where you saved the font file and double-click it to open. Click the \"Install\" button at the top of the font preview window. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nmacOS: After downloading the font file to your Mac, right-click it in Finder and select \"Open With\" > \"Font Book\". Then, click \"Install Font\" in the font preview window that pops up. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nHow to use the fonts in apps?\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually activated.\n\nNote: This font family doesn't include Bold or Italic styles, so please avoid applying them in text editors. If you use the common 'B' and 'I' buttons, you will automatically generate low-quality styles.\n\nGoogle Docs and Slides: From the font selector drop-down, go to \"More Fonts\" and search for the desired font name, in this case, \"Playwrite IT Moderna\", and click OK. If some text is already selected, the font choice will apply.\n\nMicrosoft Word: Go to Format in the Menu bar, select Font, and then the Advanced tab. Activate \"Contextual Alternates\" and \"Kerning for fonts below\" to apply these settings to all text sizes.\n\nLibreOffice: In macOS, to select the different styles, go to Format in the Menu bar, select Character, and use the Typeface menu.\n\nAdobe InDesign: Open the Paragraph Panel and select Adobe \"World-Ready Paragraph Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Illustrator: Navigate to Preferences > Type, check the \"Show Indic Options\" box, and close preferences. Then open the Paragraph Panel and select \"Middle Eastern Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Photoshop: Access the Paragraph Panel, then choose \"World-Ready Layout\" from the contextual menu.\n\nThe above instructions are also available in PDF format here."

Due to its unmistakable old Kufic style, it gives a feeling of something old, historical, or Islamic.\n\nThe Arabic component was designed by Khaled Hosny, who combined it with the Latin component by Santiago Orozco. Reem is an Arabic female name that literally means “a white deer,” and is also the name of Khaled's daughter.\n\nThis font uses the COLRv0 and CPAL tables.

    "description": "Agu Display is a distinctive typeface inspired by Nsibidi, an ancient graphic communication system from Nigeria and Cameroon's Cross River region. Used by the Ejagham, Ibibio, Efik, and Igbo peoples, Nsibidi's pictograms are deeply rooted in cultural storytelling and expression.\n\nToday, Nsibidi's symbols have found widespread use in modern design, from digital platforms like Marvel's \"Black Panther\" to print media, including fabric patterns and tattoos. Its pictographic nature allows for diverse creative applications, merging ancient art with contemporary design.\n\nAgu Display serves as a bridge between historical symbolism and modern typography. It's not just a font but a tool for cultural preservation, enabling designers to infuse their work with African heritage's depth and richness. This typeface celebrates tradition while fostering innovative expression, linking ancient communication with today's design needs.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/theseunbadejo/nsibidi-libre."

    "description": "The old posters and signs in the traditional Montserrat neighborhood of Buenos Aires inspired Julieta Ulanovsky to design this typeface and rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century. As urban development changes that place, it will never return to its original form and loses forever the designs that are so special and unique. The letters that inspired this project have work, dedication, care, color, contrast, light and life, day and night! These are the types that make the city look so beautiful. The Montserrat Project began with the idea to rescue what is in Montserrat and set it free under a libre license, the SIL Open Font License.\n\nThis is the Underline family, a sister to the normal and Alternates families. This family celebrates a special style of underline that is integrated into the letterforms found in the Montserrat neighborhood.\n\nThe Montserrat project is led by Julieta Ulanovsky, a type designer based in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

    "description": "Diplomata started several years ago when a friend in the printing industry who had an old metal typeface wanted it to be digitalized for offset printing. He brought everything the original type offered as a start, a set of upper case characters, numbers, and some punctuation marks.\n\nBut what he brought in printed form was not enough to meet his needs, and letterforms that did not exist had to be created. It is a fine job to reinterpret a design, to make decisions on what already exists and also have in mind the changes needed for the new technological context where Diplomata will be used.\n\nIts style, similar to Bodoni, has a remarkable degree of horizontal expansion; a weight which indicates verticality; areas between serif and stem softened by a curve connecting them, and the light in the main stroke of each glyph is a detail that lightens up and gives prominence to Diplomata. It is a distinct typeface, ideal for composing headlines and small prestigious pieces of text.\n\nThe February 2023 update features a bigger glyphset, fractions and some minor aesthetic modifications.\n\nTo improve and expand the use of Diplomata, it was necessary to create small caps and a lower case, which ended up constituting this family that has two variables today.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/etunni/diplomata."

    "description": "Tiro Devanagari Marathi has its origins in a typeface designed for the Murty Classical Library of India book series, so is especially suited to traditional literary publishing but also made with the needs of today’s multiple print and screen media in mind. The Tiro Devanagari design applies a contemporary approach to the traditional styling of 19th and 20th Century metal types exemplified in those of the renowned Nirnaya Sagar Press, and is characterised by broader proportions, more generous counters, and strong diagonal strokes and terminals. The Marathi font favours traditional, vertical forms of many conjuncts as still found in Marathi literary publishing. For the Open Font License release, Tiro Devanagari Marathi has been extended to support additional characters, and features a new italic companion. Each font also includes a Latin subset including diacritics for transcription of Indian languages.\n\nTiro Devanagari Marathi was designed by John Hudson and Fiona Ross. The italic was adapted by Paul Hanslow.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TiroTypeworks/Indigo.\n\nModern Tiro Indic collection for classical South Asian texts\nlink\nThe beauty and challenges of bridging the old and the new\nlink\n\nTwo type designers separated by an eight-hour time difference, an ocean, and pandemic travel bans collaborated over video calls and email to make a cohesive set of fonts in 8 South Asian languages. In 2012, Harvard University Press commissioned Fiona Ross and John Hudson, through Tiro Typeworks, to design typefaces for the Murty Classical Library of India book series. The publisher needed to reprint ancient Indian literary, historical, and religious texts, including Vedic and early Sanskrit works. Since these old texts had been printed using traditional letterforms and early Indian typography techniques, the new fonts needed to retain some of the traditional style of the old texts, yet be clear and legible in modern print and digital media.\n\nIn 2019 Google Fonts approached Tiro to make an extended and updated version of the Murty Fonts to be released as open source fonts in the Tiro Indic collection, offering users traditional text styles suitable for a variety of uses.\n\nStudy the classics and language structure\nlink\n\nBefore designing the typefaces, it was important to research classical texts and understand the unique characteristics of the languages.\n\n“We looked at very lovely manuscripts or early Indian printed materials from the 18th or 19th Centuries,” said John Hudson.\n\nTo learn more, read Modern Tiro Indic collection for classical South Asian texts."

Ga means \"to add\" in Korean. So this typeface, Gasoek, is a much thicker typeface than usual typefaces. The thick strokes fill up the embox, but by giving the right angle at the end of stroke to match with Hangeul characteristics, the font has natural counter spaces with good legibility. So, Gasoek is not just a thick font but a font that has a character and gives a unique impression.\n\nTo contribute, please visit github.com/JAMO-TYPEFACE/Gasoek."

    "description": "Amiri (أميري) is a classical Arabic typeface in Naskh style for typesetting books and other running text.\n\nAmiri is a revival of the beautiful typeface pioneered in early 20th century by Bulaq Press in Cairo, also known as Amiria Press, after which the font is named.\n\nThe uniqueness of this typeface comes from its superb balance between the beauty of Naskh calligraphy on one hand, the constraints and requirements of elegant typography on the other. Also, it is one of the few metal typefaces that were used in typesetting the Koran, making it a good source for a digital typeface to be used in typesetting Koranic verses.\n\nAmiri project aims at the revival of the aesthetics and traditions of Arabic typesetting, and adapting it to the era of digital typesetting, in a publicly available form.\n\nSee the amirifont.org website for further information and to contribute, see github.com/alif-type/amiri\n\nThis font uses the COLRv0, CPAL and SVG tables. Please visit the gf-guide color page to learn more about Color Fonts technology.\n\nالخط الأميري خط نسخي موجه لطباعة الكتب و النصوص الطويلة.\n\nالخط الأميري هو إحياء و محاكاة للخط الطباعي الجميل الذي تميزت به مطبعة بولاق منذ أوائل القرن العشرين، و التي عرفت أيضا بالمطبعة الأميرية، و من هنا أخذ الخط اسمه.\n\nيتميز خط المطابع الأميرية بجماليته و مراعاته لفن الخط العربي، بأسلوب نسخي جميل، و في ذات الوقت يراعى متطلبات الطباعة و القيود التي تفرضها، من غير إفراط في جانب على حساب الآخر. و لهذا يتميز بمناسبته للصف الطباعي عموما، و لصف الكتب خصوصا. و قد النصوص القرآنية.\n\nيهدف مشروع الخط الأميري إلى إحياء تقاليد و جماليات الطباعة العربية و موائمتها لتقنيات عصر الحواسيب، مع إتاحتها للعموم.\n\nيمكن الحصول على آخر إصدارات الخط الأميري من موقعه:\n\namirifont.org"

You can combine the main style, Solid, with the others to create different effects. The origins of the Londrina typeface project is in the streets of Sao Paulo, Brazil: Urban confusion. Initially I designed the \"New Folk\" for use in a poster, with only uppercase letters. I saw at the start some potential for a typeface that could recall the feelings of the writing used day-to-day in my city's informal communication, and developed it into a typeface family with lowercases too.\n\nTo contribute to the project, please see github.com/marcelommp/Londrina-Typeface"

    "description": "The Charles Bluemlein Script Collection is an intriguing reminder of the heady days of hand lettering and calligraphy in the United States. From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs.\n\nAlejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein."

While weights, widths and optical sizes were carefully crafted to work well in an Australian classroom environment, they are just as comfortable to read and work with in the home environment.\n\nEach Australian state teaches different handwriting styles in lower primary school (although some states do share the same style). There are essentially three stages involved with each state's styles:\n\nThe foundational stage involves learning basic letter formation.\nThe transitional stage adds joining ligatures to some letters.\nThe cursive stage joins almost all letters (with some exceptions).\n\nThe VIC WA NT School Fonts include:\n\nVictoria, Western Australia and Northern Territory Label Print Alphabet - a simple sloped print for early primary school.\nStudents in Victoria, Western Australia and Northern Territory learn Label Print from years 1 to 3 and Infant Cursive from year 4.\n\nGoogle Workspace users are provided standard versions online, however they may download or build the complete OpenType versions from GitHub for local installations. To download the full version, or to contribute, see github.com/MezMerrit/AU-School-Handwriting-Fonts.\n\nThe handwriting fonts that help Australian students learn how to read and write are now available in Google Workspace\nlink\n\nGoogle for Education Australia and Google Fonts partnered to make Foundation Fonts for Australian Schools available on Google Workspace, including Google Workspace for Education. The fonts are also available for download from the Google Fonts website.\n\nAustralian teachers are required to use state-mandated handwriting styles to teach reading and writing to school children from ages four to nine. Designed by Tina and Corey Anderson, the five Foundation Fonts exemplify proper handwriting for English and other languages using the Latin writing system, and include common math symbols. The regular weight of each font imitates the pencil thickness of handwriting, making the fonts easy for students to recognize as they learn how to write letter shapes.\n\nThe availability of these fonts on Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides is also important for the adoption of Chromebooks and Google Workspace for Education in Australian schools.\n\nTo read more, visit The handwriting fonts that help Australian students learn how to read and write are now available in Google Workspace"

    "description": "Hind Mysuru is a family of five Kannada fonts, which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. Hind Multi-Script is a type system providing nine stylistically-matching font families – one for each of the following writing systems used in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka: Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, and Sinhala. In addition to Kannada, the Hind Mysuru fonts also include Latin-script characters.\n\nDeveloped explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. Most of these strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. Additionally, Hind’s letterforms feature open apertures and counterforms. The entire family feels very legible when used to set text. Hind Mysuru’s Kannada and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that multi-script texts will sits nicely alongside each other. Since Hind Mysuru’s Kannada characters are monolinear, they have a nice, fresh feeling, and appear very modern.\n\nAside from the Latin glyphs, each of the five Hind Mysuru fonts has 444 Kannada glyphs, including many unique conjuncts. These ensure full support for the writing of the Kannada language. The Latin script’s character set is Adobe Latin 3, enabling the typesetting of English and other Western European languages.\n\nHind Mysuru is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding. Manushi Parikh designed Hind Mysuru for ITF, who first published the fonts in 2015. Hind Mysuru is named after Mysuru, a city in Karnataka, India.\n\nThe Hind Mysuru project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India.

    "description": "According to the Indian National Curriculum Framework, students must be taught three languages, starting with their home tongue, and English can be among the languages they learn. Students should learn how to write in Grades 1 and 2, but the document does not specify any methods or models for teaching handwriting.\n\nThe new NCERT textbooks for English are titled Mridang. The book for grade 1 teaches students print-style letterforms. No cursive writing instruction appears in this or the grade 2 textbook. However, NCERT’s previous English textbook series, called Marigold, focused on cursive writing in grade 2 (7–8 years old) and showed samples in a style similar to one developed by Irish-born British diplomat, Vere Foster, in the second half of the nineteenth century. Further, handwriting textbooks produced by a major private publisher directly attribute the samples in their volumes to Foster’s model.\n\nPlaywrite India is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite IN Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite India characteristics\nlink\n\nThis slanted continuous cursive style features medium-length extenders and draws inspiration from Vere Foster's New Civil Service writing models. The script includes decorative capital letters, with 'A' and 'H' particularly notable for their elaborated crossbars. Lowercase letters are designed with loops on both ascenders and descenders, and several letters begin with curved entry strokes. The letter 'r' is distinguished by a knot, and 'q' is characterized by a short exit stroke in its descender.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite India appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘IN’, Playwrite IN, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in India, see primarium.info/countries/india.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer. Navigate to where you saved the font file and double-click it to open. Click the \"Install\" button at the top of the font preview window. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nmacOS: After downloading the font file to your Mac, right-click it in Finder and select \"Open With\" > \"Font Book\". Then, click \"Install Font\" in the font preview window that pops up. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nHow to use the fonts in apps?\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually activated.\n\nNote: This font family doesn't include Bold or Italic styles, so please avoid applying them in text editors. If you use the common 'B' and 'I' buttons, you will automatically generate low-quality styles.\n\nGoogle Docs and Slides: From the font selector drop-down, go to \"More Fonts\" and search for the desired font name, in this case, \"Playwrite IN\", and click OK. If some text is already selected, the font choice will apply.\n\nMicrosoft Word: Go to Format in the Menu bar, select Font, and then the Advanced tab. Activate \"Contextual Alternates\" and \"Kerning for fonts below\" to apply these settings to all text sizes.\n\nLibreOffice: In macOS, to select the different styles, go to Format in the Menu bar, select Character, and use the Typeface menu.\n\nAdobe InDesign: Open the Paragraph Panel and select Adobe \"World-Ready Paragraph Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Illustrator: Navigate to Preferences > Type, check the \"Show Indic Options\" box, and close preferences. Then open the Paragraph Panel and select \"Middle Eastern Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Photoshop: Access the Paragraph Panel, then choose \"World-Ready Layout\" from the contextual menu.\n\nThe above instructions are also available in PDF format here."

He brought everything the original type offered as a start, a set of upper case characters, numbers, and some punctuation marks.\n\nBut what he brought in printed form was not enough to meet his needs, and letterforms that did not exist had to be created. It is a fine job to reinterpret a design, to make decisions on what already exists and also have in mind the changes needed for the new technological context where Diplomata will be used.\n\nIts style, similar to Bodoni, has a remarkable degree of horizontal expansion; a weight which indicates verticality; areas between serif and stem softened by a curve connecting them, and the light in the main stroke of each glyph is a detail that lightens up and gives prominence to Diplomata. It is a distinct typeface, ideal for composing headlines and small prestigious pieces of text.\n\nThe February 2023 update features a bigger glyphset, fractions and some minor aesthetic modifications.\n\nTo improve and expand the use of Diplomata, it was necessary to create small caps and a lower case, which ended up constituting this family that has two variables today.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/etunni/diplomata."

    "description": "All Australian provinces employ modern cursive letters for handwriting education, which are taught in a progressive manner. But each state teaches its own version of this style, locally known as ‘script‘, and state-level departments of education offer guidelines and, in some cases, resources for schools and teachers.\n\nThe adoption of the current models and approach can be traced back to 1990, when the Australian Education Council (AEC) recommended that all schools in the country should adopt a handwriting style based on Scottish calligrapher Tom Gourdie’s Simple Modern Hand. The AEC advocated for a consistent style in handwriting instruction across the country so students relocating across states and territories would not face difficulties. Despite starting from the same source, today the five main handwriting models have diverged somewhat in their details.\n\nPlaywrite Australia SA is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite AU SA Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Australia SA characteristics\nlink\n\nThis semi-connected, slanted modern cursive features print-style capital letters. The extenders are loopless, and letters with descenders do not connect to the next letter, facilitating a brisk writing pace. Key characteristics include an open 'G' without a crossbar, a serifed 'I', and the 'Y', which also stands out with its unusual design. The lowercase 'f' is disconnected and comes with a straight descender. The 'q' is noted for its short exit stroke, while the 'k' is uniquely designed with two strokes. Both 'r' and 'z' are presented in an italic style, contributing to the elegance of this script.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Australia SA appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘AU’ and a the ‘SA’ abbreviation Playwrite AU SA. It features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in australia, see primarium.info/countries/australia.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer. Navigate to where you saved the font file and double-click it to open. Click the \"Install\" button at the top of the font preview window. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nmacOS: After downloading the font file to your Mac, right-click it in Finder and select \"Open With\" > \"Font Book\". Then, click \"Install Font\" in the font preview window that pops up. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nHow to use the fonts in apps?\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually activated.\n\nNote: This font family doesn't include Bold or Italic styles, so please avoid applying them in text editors. If you use the common 'B' and 'I' buttons, you will automatically generate low-quality styles.\n\nGoogle Docs and Slides: From the font selector drop-down, go to \"More Fonts\" and search for the desired font name, in this case, \"Playwrite AU SA\", and click OK. If some text is already selected, the font choice will apply.\n\nMicrosoft Word: Go to Format in the Menu bar, select Font, and then the Advanced tab. Activate \"Contextual Alternates\" and \"Kerning for fonts below\" to apply these settings to all text sizes.\n\nLibreOffice: In macOS, to select the different styles, go to Format in the Menu bar, select Character, and use the Typeface menu.\n\nAdobe InDesign: Open the Paragraph Panel and select Adobe \"World-Ready Paragraph Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Illustrator: Navigate to Preferences > Type, check the \"Show Indic Options\" box, and close preferences. Then open the Paragraph Panel and select \"Middle Eastern Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Photoshop: Access the Paragraph Panel, then choose \"World-Ready Layout\" from the contextual menu.\n\nThe above instructions are also available in PDF format here."

    "description": "Anek, as the meaning of the word suggests, is an exercise in multiplicity — multiple scripts designed in multiple weights and widths by multiple designers. A well-informed, conscientious and refreshing interpretation of India’s letter traditions, this family offers a versatile system that can meet the demands of a wide range of applications.\n\nIts expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep structures compact for that graphic texture. On the wide end of the spectrum, the extra legroom lets each letter yawn and stretch into their message. But it is in the boldest weights that Anek comes alive. Sharp terminals and tapered joineries sparkle amidst regimented forms, making this ideal for setting titillating headlines or that magnetic word-mark.\n\nAnek comes in ten scripts: Bangla, Devanagari, Kannada, Latin, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu. The shared aesthetics of this type-family are drawn from a collaboratively decided pool of visual features. At the same time, each script amalgamates influences from its own typographic culture as well as the perspectives of individual designers.\n\nThis project is designed, engineered and maintained by Ek Type; a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces. Contributors of this project are: Maithili Shingre (Anek Malayalam, Anek Kannada), Yesha Goshar (Anek Latin, Anek Odia), Kailash Malviya (Anek Devanagari), Aadarsh Rajan (Anek Tamil), Sulekha Rajkumar (Anek Bangla), Vaishnavi Murthy (Anek Kannada), Omkar Bhoir (Anek Telugu), Mrunmayee Ghaisas (Anek Gujarati), Mahesh Sahu (Anek Odia), and Sarang Kulkarni (Anek Gurmukhi). Project management and design assistance by Noopur Datye, and Font engineering and design assistance by Girish Dalvi.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/EkType/Anek\n\nMultiple scripts for multilingual India\nlink\nThe award-winning Anek variable font\nlink\nThe nine scripts have base characters in the center, with vowel signs and conjuncts that come above, below or next to them.\n\nThe Anek multi-script typeface for 9 Indian languages and Latin was made through a collaboration of 12 type designers working across 8 cities in India.\n\nHow did Ek Type win two type design awards (the TDC Certificate of Typographic Excellence and the D&AD Graphite Pencil) for their Anek multi-script typeface?\n\nThere were two key factors to their success:\n\nTeamwork: The team of 12 collaborated democratically.\nEquality: Giving equal value to each of the nine Indian writing systems (scripts) and Latin, while maintaining both common visual features and script-specific characteristics.\nTeamwork during lockdown\nlink\n\nGetting 12 people to collaborate while speaking in three languages (English, Hindi, and Marathi) and spread out in eight different Indian cities (Mumbai, Pune, Kalyan, Hinganghat, Baroda, Bengaluru, Bharampur, and Pali) is not an easy task.\n\nEk Type established a collaboration structure that fostered teamwork, while also giving designers the liberty to be creative.\n\nThe team consisted of Maithili Shingre, Yesha Goshar, Kailash Malviya, Aadarsh Rajan, Sulekha Rajkumar, Vaishnavi Murthy, Omkar Bhoir, Mrunmayee Ghaisas, Mahesh Sahu, Sarang Kulkarni, Noopur Datye, and Girish Dalvi.\n\nTen people focused on one script each, while the other two members worked on font engineering and project management. The designers focused on the script that was most familiar to them.\n\nVia three- to four-hour weekly video calls, team members annotated drawings with emojis, arrows, text, and other marks in their video conference platform. In between calls, the team collaborated online. The team made design decisions based on majority or unanimous votes.\n\nBefore the pandemic, most of the team had worked together at the Ek Type studio in Mumbai. Remote work created some unforeseen benefits. “Everyone had the time to venture in different directions, not getting colored by what the others were doing,” said Noopur Datye, co-founder and type designer at Ek Type.\n\nTo learn more, read Multilingual scripts for multilingual India."

    "description": "Playwrite México Guides is a single-weight font designed to harmonize seamlessly with its companion, Playwrite México. This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.\n\nSince the 1992 educational reform, the curricula for primary education no longer provide details about handwriting instruction or specific writing models. Moreover, it grants teachers the freedom to choose teaching methods for reading and writing instruction during the earliest stages. However, nearly all private schools and most public ones teach cursive writing — either alongside or sequentially — with print letters. But the resources they use for teaching cursive writing are privately acquired from publishing houses or created by teachers themselves.\n\nIn this context, local type designers have been commissioned to create typefaces that match the styles familiar to teachers. These typefaces are usually similar to North American penmanship models, more likely, a derivative from the National Commission of Free Textbooks workbooks dating back to the 1960s.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite México Guides characteristics\nlink\n\nGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing. To create a versatile font for teachers designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. It replaces the glyph shape with the guidelines and matches the width of the letter space.\n\nFind the detailed characteristics of this country's Model in Playwrite México.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite México Guides appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘MX’, Playwrite MX Guides, and features a single Regular weight.\nThe download .zip file includes the static font for this guided version.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in Mexico, see primarium.info/countries/mexico.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer. Navigate to where you saved the font file and double-click it to open. Click the \"Install\" button at the top of the font preview window. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nmacOS: After downloading the font file to your Mac, right-click it in Finder and select \"Open With\" > \"Font Book\". Then, click \"Install Font\" in the font preview window that pops up. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nHow to use the fonts in apps?\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually activated.\n\nNote: This font family doesn't include Bold or Italic styles, so please avoid applying them in text editors. If you use the common 'B' and 'I' buttons, you will automatically generate low-quality styles.\n\nGoogle Docs and Slides: From the font selector drop-down, go to \"More Fonts\" and search for the desired font name, in this case, \"Playwrite MX Guides\", and click OK. If some text is already selected, the font choice will apply.\n\nMicrosoft Word: Go to Format in the Menu bar, select Font, and then the Advanced tab. Activate \"Contextual Alternates\" and \"Kerning for fonts below\" to apply these settings to all text sizes.\n\nLibreOffice: In macOS, to select the different styles, go to Format in the Menu bar, select Character, and use the Typeface menu.\n\nAdobe InDesign: Open the Paragraph Panel and select Adobe \"World-Ready Paragraph Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Illustrator: Navigate to Preferences > Type, check the \"Show Indic Options\" box, and close preferences. Then open the Paragraph Panel and select \"Middle Eastern Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Photoshop: Access the Paragraph Panel, then choose \"World-Ready Layout\" from the contextual menu.\n\nThe above instructions are also available in PDF format here."

    "description": "Sixtyfour Convergence is the COLRv1 companion of Sixtyfour a font inspired by the article Raster CRT Typography by Norbert Landsteiner, and is a rework of some old pixel versions of the Commodore 64.\n\nDue to this project's specificity and the fonts' historical origin, they only support a limited set of glyphs.\n\nThis font uses the COLRv1 and CPAL tables. Please visit the gf-guide color page to learn more about Color Fonts technology.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/jenskutilek/homecomputer-fonts.\n\nHomecomputer Fonts\nlink\n\nThese fonts are inspired by the interface fonts of two classic 1980s computers, the Commodore C64 (Sixtyfour) and Amiga (Workbench). When Jens Kutilek adapted them to the variable font technology, he did not just convert the pixel fonts, but tried to emulate the artifacts of rendering letters on a CRT screen.\n\nThe above fonts include two custom axes: Scanlines, which allows control of the height of the lines and, as a result of this, the amount of vertical space between the lines. And Bleed to change the amount of horizontal bleed of the pixels due to the phosphor latency found in CRT displays.\n\nSixtyfour Convergence\nlink\n\nSixtyfour Convergence is Simon Cozens's COLRv1 take on Sixtyfour, which introduces two additional new custom axes: Horizontal Element Alignment and Vertical Element Alignment. These axes allow the control of the position of three painted layers, reproducing the control of the offset positions of the red, green, and blue colors common on CRT monitors."

It is primarily designed for body text and intended for various professional communication. Its special qualities of letter shapes and subtle contrast modulation articulate grace and expressivity. Arsenal's somewhat lyrical sentiment abides to the Ukrainian nature of the font.\n\nMain design features: narrow proportions that allow for economical type-setting, moderate aperture and observable contrast. Notable traits: neutrality, clarity, swiftness.\n\nThis is the Small Cap sibling family to the main Arsenal family."

In 2012, Harvard University Press commissioned Fiona Ross and John Hudson, through Tiro Typeworks, to design typefaces for the Murty Classical Library of India book series. The publisher needed to reprint ancient Indian literary, historical, and religious texts, including Vedic and early Sanskrit works. Since these old texts had been printed using traditional letterforms and early Indian typography techniques, the new fonts needed to retain some of the traditional style of the old texts, yet be clear and legible in modern print and digital media.\n\nIn 2019 Google Fonts approached Tiro to make an extended and updated version of the Murty Fonts to be released as open source fonts in the Tiro Indic collection, offering users traditional text styles suitable for a variety of uses.\n\nStudy the classics and language structure\nlink\n\nBefore designing the typefaces, it was important to research classical texts and understand the unique characteristics of the languages.\n\n“We looked at very lovely manuscripts or early Indian printed materials from the 18th or 19th Centuries,” said John Hudson.\n\nTo learn more, read Modern Tiro Indic collection for classical South Asian texts."

    "description": "The design of new Greek typefaces always followed the growing needs of the Classical Studies in the major European Universities. Furthermore, by the end of the 19th century bibliology had become an established section of Historical Studies, and, as John Bowman commented, the prevailing attitude was that Greek types should adhere to a lost idealized, yet undefined, greekness of yore. Especially in Great Britain this tendency remained unchallenged in the first decades of the 20th century, both by Richard Proctor, curator of the incunabula section in the British Museum Library and his successor Victor Scholderer. In 1927, Scholderer, on behalf of the Society for the Promotion of Greek Studies, got involved in choosing and consulting the design and production of a Greek type called New Hellenic cut by the Lanston Monotype Corporation. He chose the revival of a round, and almost monoline type which had first appeared in 1492 in the edition of Macrobius, ascribable to the printing shop of Giovanni Rosso (Joannes Rubeus) in Venice. New Hellenic was the only successful typeface in Great Britain after the introduction of Porson Greek well over a century before. The type, since to 1930’s, was also well received in Greece, albeit with a different design for Ξ and Ω. GFS digitized the typeface (1993-1994) funded by the Athens Archeological Society with the addition of a new set of epigraphical symbols. Later (2000) more weights were added (italic, bold and bold italic) as well as a latin version."

The typface reflects Hedvig’s brand philosophy “Stuff happens” – embracing all the things that happen in life, without worry or fear.\n\nThe typeface family Hedvig Letters consists of two fonts:\n\n\nHedvig Letters Serif is designed to balance punchy and honest copy with responsibility and comfort.\nHedvig Letters Sans takes the role of the work-horse typeface in Hedvig’s visual toolbox.\n\nThe concept for the typeface was developed by approaching a “non-type-designer” point of view. Optical corrections are usually applied to a typeface to fool the eye that certain shapes are balanced or aligned, when in reality they are not. For this typeface, the imperfections were embraced instead of corrected. The result is a typeface where some letters have a slightly odd, yet characteristic look that effectively communicates Hedvig’s brand and design philosophy.\n\nTo contribute, please see github.com/KanonFoundry/HedvigLetters."

    "description": "Jacquard is an expanded revival typeface from a Victorian needlepoint alphabet designed in Berlin by Heinrich Kuehn circa 1880.\n\nDesigning typefaces for knitting is essentially the same as creating pixel types. However, in practice, the pixel size is determined by the properties of the yarn in use. Scale is determined by the weight of the yarn as well as the number of pixels that make up the height of each letter. In this collection, the number following the typeface's name indicates the height of the capital letters for that typeface.\n\nThese typefaces were designed with machine knitting in mind, but could be used for hand knitting, needlework, bedazzling, or many other textile crafts.\n\nNote: For Fair Isle knitting, you need to beware of floats and plan accordingly, as always.\n\nEach typeface has a “Regular” and “Charted” version, and some include multiple scales so you can fit type on your knits, no matter the project's size. Check out the charted version Jacquard 24 Charted.\n\nTo contribute, please see github.com/scfried/soft-type-jacquard."

    "description": "Atkinson Hyperlegible Mono, a monospace version of Atkinson Hyperlegible, offers new opportunities for developers with low vision. Atkinson Hyperlegible Mono includes new weights, refined curves, added symbols, and additional language support.\n\nNamed after the founder of the Braille Institute, Atkinson Hyperlegible Mono has been developed specifically to increase legibility for readers with low vision, and to improve reading comprehension.\n\nHaving a traditional grotesque sans-serif at its core, it departs from tradition to incorporate unambiguous, distinctive elements—and at times, unexpected forms—always with the goal of increasing character recognition and ultimately improving reading.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/atkinson-hyperlegible-next-mono.\n\n \nFrom Rebranding to Readability with Atkinson Hyperlegible\nlink\nDistinct and modern, the Atkinson Hyperlegible typeface aims to deliver both legibility and readability\nlink\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), at least 2.2 billion people have a vision impairment. Major financial burdens can occur when people can’t read fluently or work to their full potential. For example, the WHO estimates that “losses associated with vision impairment from uncorrected myopia and presbyopia alone were estimated to be US$ 244 billion and US$ 25.4 billion, respectively.” Typeface design can help.\n\nWhen Braille Institute hired Applied Design Works to create a new brand identity and branding strategy to coincide with their 2019 centennial anniversary, the firm looked for a beautiful and functional font specifically designed for improved legibility and readability. Brad Scott and Elliott Scott of Applied Design Works were concerned about typefaces that look a little like old ransom notes, where each letter and number were dramatically different from each other. They wondered if, despite designers’ intentions, these typefaces could actually be more difficult to read for some people. They decided that no existing typeface met their legibility, readability, and branding goals. So they endeavored to create a new typeface called Atkinson Hyperlegible, named after the organization’s founder J. Robert Atkinson. The work would go on to be recognized with a 2019 Fast Company ‘Innovation by Design’ Award."

    "description": "Orbit is inspired by the concept of monospaced Latin coding fonts. Korean fonts are usually already monospaced, but by bringing the impression of the Latin coding font in the Hangeul and punctuation design, Orbit gives a mathematical and geometric impression through a serif with right angle and orbicular circles. The font attempts to express orbitals with typeface using symmetry and connectivity to create a somewhat cosmic and futuristic atmosphere. As it is reminiscent of coding interface screens, it is recommended to use bright writing on a dark background, below 10pt.\n\nTo contribute, please visit github.com/JAMO-TYPEFACE/Orbit."

    "description": "England has been the incubator for several prominent handwriting styles that still influence teaching around the world. One of the earliest examples is the English Roundhand, which was used in business and education in the 19th century.\n\nThe implementation of modern cursive styles in classrooms is probably the most influential development for contemporary handwriting education. They draw from the ideas of the Italic Handwriting Revival movement of the early 20th century, and the work of its proponents. Alfred Fairbank (1895–1982) proposed modern italic writing, based on chancery models, as a new approach to teaching handwriting with the aim of simplification and faster writing speed. Recently, it has been one of the most popular approaches to handwriting teaching in England. Of the twenty-three methods described in the National Handwriting Association’s 2013 guide to writing methods for teaching, thirteen were fully joined or semi-joined modern cursive styles. Important among these are Nelson Handwriting, Tom Gourdie Modern Hand, Jarman Handwriting, Marion Richardson, and Sassoon-Williams model.\n\nPlaywrite England SemiJoined is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite GB S Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite England SemiJoined characteristics\nlink\n\nThis semi-connected modern cursive is offered in both upright and slanted (italic) versions. It features short, loopless ascenders and descenders, with simplified print-like uppercase letters. Notable characteristics include an open 'G' without a crossbar and an 'M' with plain legs. The lowercase 'f' has a curved descending stroke, and the 'q' is distinguished by a flick in its descender. True to this style, there are no curved entry strokes, and letters ending in a right-to-left stroke, such as 'b', 'p', 'g', and 's', do not connect to the following letter.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite England SemiJoined appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘GB’ and an ‘S’ for the SemiJoined, Playwrite GB S. The font features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\n \nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in England, see primarium.info/countries/england.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer. Navigate to where you saved the font file and double-click it to open. Click the \"Install\" button at the top of the font preview window. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nmacOS: After downloading the font file to your Mac, right-click it in Finder and select \"Open With\" > \"Font Book\". Then, click \"Install Font\" in the font preview window that pops up. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nHow to use the fonts in apps?\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually activated.\n\nNote: This font family doesn't include Bold style, so please avoid applying it in text editors. If you use the common 'B' button, you will automatically generate a low-quality style.\n\nGoogle Docs and Slides: From the font selector drop-down, go to \"More Fonts\" and search for the desired font name, in this case, \"Playwrite GB S\", and click OK. If some text is already selected, the font choice will apply.\n\nMicrosoft Word: Go to Format in the Menu bar, select Font, and then the Advanced tab. Activate \"Contextual Alternates\" and \"Kerning for fonts below\" to apply these settings to all text sizes.\n\nLibreOffice: In macOS, to select the different styles, go to Format in the Menu bar, select Character, and use the Typeface menu.\n\nAdobe InDesign: Open the Paragraph Panel and select Adobe \"World-Ready Paragraph Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Illustrator: Navigate to Preferences > Type, check the \"Show Indic Options\" box, and close preferences. Then open the Paragraph Panel and select \"Middle Eastern Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Photoshop: Access the Paragraph Panel, then choose \"World-Ready Layout\" from the contextual menu.\n\nThe above instructions are also available in PDF format here."

    "description": "The Dutch-French language divide in Belgium, a phenomenon with roots stretching back to the Middle Ages, continues to be relevant in the country today. Traditions of handwriting education exemplify this circumstance and reflect the country's historical ties to France and the Netherlands. Regardless of the handwriting model adopted, students learn print-style script letters in kindergarten and progress to connected letters in primary school. In Flanders, there is a preference for sloped continuous cursive writing, reminiscent of Dutch handwriting models, whereas the French-speaking community in the Walloon region opts for upright cursive writing, a style that enjoys popularity in France. This diversity in handwriting education is a direct response to Belgium's rich linguistic culture, leading to the introduction of a second official language early in the school years.\n\nPlaywrite België Vlaanderen is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite BE VLG Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite België Vlaanderen characteristics\nlink\n\nThis style is a slanted, fully connected continuous cursive. It features decorative capital letters, some of which, like 'A', closely resemble a cursive structure. The extenders are of medium length, enhancing the fluidity. 'T' and 'Z' are designed with a crossbar, while 'X' includes loops that facilitates continuous writing without lifting the pen. The 'S' maintains a straight spine. The lowercase 'f' features only a top loop, connecting from its crossbar, and the 't' has a crossbar that extends only to the right, giving it a distinctive appearance.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite België Vlaanderen appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘BE’ and a the ‘VLG’ abbreviation Playwrite BE VLG. It features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in australia, see primarium.info/countries/belgium.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer. Navigate to where you saved the font file and double-click it to open. Click the \"Install\" button at the top of the font preview window. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nmacOS: After downloading the font file to your Mac, right-click it in Finder and select \"Open With\" > \"Font Book\". Then, click \"Install Font\" in the font preview window that pops up. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nHow to use the fonts in apps?\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually activated.\n\nNote: This font family doesn't include Bold or Italic styles, so please avoid applying them in text editors. If you use the common 'B' and 'I' buttons, you will automatically generate low-quality styles.\n\nGoogle Docs and Slides: From the font selector drop-down, go to \"More Fonts\" and search for the desired font name, in this case, \"Playwrite BE VLG\", and click OK. If some text is already selected, the font choice will apply.\n\nMicrosoft Word: Go to Format in the Menu bar, select Font, and then the Advanced tab. Activate \"Contextual Alternates\" and \"Kerning for fonts below\" to apply these settings to all text sizes.\n\nLibreOffice: In macOS, to select the different styles, go to Format in the Menu bar, select Character, and use the Typeface menu.\n\nAdobe InDesign: Open the Paragraph Panel and select Adobe \"World-Ready Paragraph Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Illustrator: Navigate to Preferences > Type, check the \"Show Indic Options\" box, and close preferences. Then open the Paragraph Panel and select \"Middle Eastern Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Photoshop: Access the Paragraph Panel, then choose \"World-Ready Layout\" from the contextual menu.\n\nThe above instructions are also available in PDF format here."

    "description": "Tiro Kannada has its origins in a typeface designed for the Murty Classical Library of India book series, so is especially suited to traditional literary publishing but also made with the needs of today’s multiple print and screen media in mind. The design takes inspiration from several sources: the crisp, open counters of the 19th Century types of the renowned Basel Mission Press; the styling of ligatures in types of the Gujarat Type Foundry from the 1930s; and the dynamic stroke angles of unattributed types found in a 20th Century Kannada textbook. Tiro Kannada features generously proportioned subscript letters for enhanced legibility. For the Open Font License release, Tiro Kannada has been extended to support additional characters, and features a new italic companion. Each font also includes a Latin subset including diacritics for transcription of Indian languages.\n\nTiro Kannada was designed by John Hudson and Fiona Ross. The italic was adapted by Kaja Słojewska.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TiroTypeworks/Indigo.\n\nModern Tiro Indic collection for classical South Asian texts\nlink\nThe beauty and challenges of bridging the old and the new\nlink\n\nTwo type designers separated by an eight-hour time difference, an ocean, and pandemic travel bans collaborated over video calls and email to make a cohesive set of fonts in 8 South Asian languages. In 2012, Harvard University Press commissioned Fiona Ross and John Hudson, through Tiro Typeworks, to design typefaces for the Murty Classical Library of India book series. The publisher needed to reprint ancient Indian literary, historical, and religious texts, including Vedic and early Sanskrit works. Since these old texts had been printed using traditional letterforms and early Indian typography techniques, the new fonts needed to retain some of the traditional style of the old texts, yet be clear and legible in modern print and digital media.\n\nIn 2019 Google Fonts approached Tiro to make an extended and updated version of the Murty Fonts to be released as open source fonts in the Tiro Indic collection, offering users traditional text styles suitable for a variety of uses.\n\nStudy the classics and language structure\nlink\n\nBefore designing the typefaces, it was important to research classical texts and understand the unique characteristics of the languages.\n\n“We looked at very lovely manuscripts or early Indian printed materials from the 18th or 19th Centuries,” said John Hudson.\n\nTo learn more, read Modern Tiro Indic collection for classical South Asian texts."

While weights, widths and optical sizes were carefully crafted to work well in an Australian classroom environment, they are just as comfortable to read and work with in the home environment.\n\nEach Australian state teaches different handwriting styles in lower primary school (although some states do share the same style). There are essentially three stages involved with each state's styles:\n\nThe foundational stage involves learning basic letter formation.\nThe transitional stage adds joining ligatures to some letters.\nThe cursive stage joins almost all letters (with some exceptions).\n\nThe QLD School Fonts include both:\n\nQueensland Beginners Alphabet - a simple sloped print for early primary school.\nQueensland Beginners Cursive - transitional joining letter alternates (pre-cursive stage).\nStudents in Queensland learn QBeginners from years 1 to 3 and QCursive from year 4.\n\nGoogle Workspace users are provided standard versions online, however they may download or build the complete OpenType versions from GitHub for local installations. To download the full version, or to contribute, see github.com/MezMerrit/AU-School-Handwriting-Fonts.\n\nThe handwriting fonts that help Australian students learn how to read and write are now available in Google Workspace\nlink\n\nGoogle for Education Australia and Google Fonts partnered to make Foundation Fonts for Australian Schools available on Google Workspace, including Google Workspace for Education. The fonts are also available for download from the Google Fonts website.\n\nAustralian teachers are required to use state-mandated handwriting styles to teach reading and writing to school children from ages four to nine. Designed by Tina and Corey Anderson, the five Foundation Fonts exemplify proper handwriting for English and other languages using the Latin writing system, and include common math symbols. The regular weight of each font imitates the pencil thickness of handwriting, making the fonts easy for students to recognize as they learn how to write letter shapes.\n\nThe availability of these fonts on Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides is also important for the adoption of Chromebooks and Google Workspace for Education in Australian schools.\n\nTo read more, visit The handwriting fonts that help Australian students learn how to read and write are now available in Google Workspace"

    "description": "MATEMASIE\nlink\n\nMatemasie is an ultra-bold display typeface distinguished by rounded edges and top-weighted letterforms. It is inspired by the Adinkra symbol \"Mate Masie,\" meaning \"what I hear, I keep\" — embodying the importance of listening and communication in oral traditions. The typeface symbolizes the principles of communication, wisdom, knowledge, prudence, and connection.\n\nThe goal of the typeface is a celebration of African heritage while meeting contemporary design standards. Adinkra symbols express themes connected to the history, beliefs, and philosophy of the Asante people, often with proverbial meanings that signify wisdom. These symbols also describe historical events, human and animal behavior, plant forms, and object shapes.\n\nDrawing on this Adinkra symbol, the design connects with Africa's rich graphical heritage. The creation of Matemasie was a journey to craft a typeface that resonates with the spirit of Africa, drawing deeply from its roots.\n\nThe design process involved connecting the past and present, preserving the essence of African heritage for future generations. Matemasie celebrates the harmony between tradition and innovation, reflecting the balance embodied by the \"Mate Masie\" symbol.\n\nTraditionally, the Mate Masie symbol is represented by four linked ears—two on top and two on the bottom. This 2-by-2 arrangement is a fundamental aspect of the symbol, signifying balance and rhythm, when it is presented in traditional designs. This rhythmic balance played a crucial role in developing the letterforms of the Matemasie font. By integrating this cultural structure into the digital design, Matemasie stays deeply connected to its cultural roots, preserving the essence of the symbol while adapting it for contemporary use.\n\nThe design process aimed to respect and reflect the traditional symbolism, allowing the modern typeface to serve as both a functional tool and a cultural tribute. The typeface captures both the artistic and spiritual essence of \"Mate Masie\" through its unique typographic features.\n\nMatemasie is more than a collection of letters; it is a testament to the rich mosaic of African culture and tradition. Like the symbol that inspired it, Matemasie whispers stories of ancient wisdom and caution through its elegant curves. It is hoped that Matemasie's story will continue to evolve with various styles, inspiring typographers to explore the depths of African culture and wisdom."

    "description": "Primary school curricula in Argentina focus on writing mostly from a comprehension and composition standpoint rather than from the perspective of handwriting. Even so, primary school students learn how to write with joined upright cursive letters from first or second grade. In the initial level, students learn print-style uppercase letters, followed by print lowercase letters in the first grade, and finally, cursive writing.\n\nPlaywrite Argentina is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling font with Guides, Playwrite AR Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Argentina characteristics\nlink\n\nAs it happens in many South American countries, handwriting for primary education is rooted in the tradition of French Normal schools. It is a round, continuous cursive style, and some of its most recognizable features are the long ascenders and descender loops, semi-connected uppercase letters, curved entry strokes on x-height, the knot in the letter 'o', and a crossbar in 'q' that requires a pen lift.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Argentina appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘AR’, Playwrite AR, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in Argentina, see primarium.info/countries/argentina.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer.

    "description": "Tiro Gurmukhi has its origins in a typeface designed for the Murty Classical Library of India book series, so is especially suited to traditional literary publishing but also made with the needs of today’s multiple print and screen media in mind. The design reintroduces the stroke modulation of traditional Punjabi manuscript styles that is absent from the monolinear typefaces that became conventional for the script in the 20th Century. This gives Tiro Gurmukhi a strong traditional flavour while also something fresh in the context of modern typography. For the Open Font License release, Tiro Gurmukhi has been extended to support additional characters, and features a new italic companion. Each font also includes a Latin subset including diacritics for transcription of Indian languages.\n\nTiro Gurmukhi was designed by John Hudson and Fiona Ross. The italic was adapted by Paul Hanslow.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TiroTypeworks/Indigo.\n\nModern Tiro Indic collection for classical South Asian texts\nlink\nThe beauty and challenges of bridging the old and the new\nlink\n\nTwo type designers separated by an eight-hour time difference, an ocean, and pandemic travel bans collaborated over video calls and email to make a cohesive set of fonts in 8 South Asian languages. In 2012, Harvard University Press commissioned Fiona Ross and John Hudson, through Tiro Typeworks, to design typefaces for the Murty Classical Library of India book series. The publisher needed to reprint ancient Indian literary, historical, and religious texts, including Vedic and early Sanskrit works. Since these old texts had been printed using traditional letterforms and early Indian typography techniques, the new fonts needed to retain some of the traditional style of the old texts, yet be clear and legible in modern print and digital media.\n\nIn 2019 Google Fonts approached Tiro to make an extended and updated version of the Murty Fonts to be released as open source fonts in the Tiro Indic collection, offering users traditional text styles suitable for a variety of uses.\n\nStudy the classics and language structure\nlink\n\nBefore designing the typefaces, it was important to research classical texts and understand the unique characteristics of the languages.\n\n“We looked at very lovely manuscripts or early Indian printed materials from the 18th or 19th Centuries,” said John Hudson.\n\nTo learn more, read Modern Tiro Indic collection for classical South Asian texts."

    "description": "Primary school handwriting in Spain features letters that are cursive from a structural standpoint but have no slant. These upright cursive letters are either taught in the form of a hybrid style, which uses joined cursive lowercase letters with unjoined simplified print uppercase, or as a fully cursive style, which features ornate, and more traditional and decorative uppercase letters. The hybrid style is used in textbooks by major educational publishers, such as Cuadernos Rubio, Santillana Educación, Editorial Barcanova, and Tekman Education.\n\nPlaywrite España is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite ES Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite España characteristics\nlink\n\nThis continuous cursive is inspired by traditional French models, featuring medium-length ascenders and descenders with loops. Several lowercase letters begin with curved entry strokes, and a few, such as 'b' and 'p', include knots. The letter 'z' is distinctively styled in italic fashion, adding a recognizable touch to this script. The uppercase letters are simplified and print-like, with the letter 'I' notably having serifs.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite España appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘ES’ Playwrite ES, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.

    "description": "The most recent version of the National Core Curriculum, published in 2020, describes exercises aimed at preparing students for writing and emphasizes the acquisition of reading skills and comprehension. It does not mention any models for handwriting instruction. However, an official teacher’s manual called Tanítói Kézikönyv prescribes the use of workbooks published by the Minisztere through its Oktatási Hivatal, or Educational Authority.\n\nThere are several handwriting instruction books in the catalog. Among them, the most popular series are Írás Munkafüzet and Betubarangolo, both edited by the staff of the Oktatási Hivatal and with visual and typographic design by László Kajtár. These publications follow the most common approach used in handwriting education in Hungary: both print and cursive letters are introduced from first grade, and the cursive letters are upright, wide, round, and have looped extenders.\n\nPlaywrite Magyarország is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite HU Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Magyarország characteristics\nlink\n\nInspired by the Sütterlin German style, this vertical continuous cursive features short and sometimes looped ascenders and descenders. The script is rounded and slowly constructed, with subtly decorative uppercase letters. The lowercase 'f' features a single loop in its ascender and connects to the next letter from its crossbar. The letter 'r' is unique in this model as it is the only letter that starts with a curved entry stroke at the x-height.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Magyarország appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘HU’, Playwrite HU, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.

This is the Tamil script part of the family, with Upright styles in two weights, Regular and Bold.\n\nThe Latin part is available from the Karla specimen page.\n\nKarla Tamil does not currently work on iPhones and iPads, because iOS doesn't render OpenType Layout shaping, only AAT shaping. Mac OS X, Windows and GNU+Linux all render OpenType Layout shaping. These Tamil fonts do not have AAT shaping, so they won't render correctly, but the iOS system font does.\n\nTo contribute to the project contact Jonathan Pinhorn."

    "description": "Since the 1992 educational reform, the curricula for primary education no longer provide details about handwriting instruction or specific writing models. Moreover, it grants teachers the freedom to choose teaching methods for reading and writing instruction during the earliest stages. However, nearly all private schools and most public ones teach cursive writing — either alongside or sequentially — with print letters. But the resources they use for teaching cursive writing are privately acquired from publishing houses or created by teachers themselves.\n\nIn this context, local type designers have been commissioned to create typefaces that match the styles familiar to teachers. These typefaces are usually similar to North American penmanship models, more likely, a derivative from the National Commission of Free Textbooks workbooks dating back to the 1960s.\n\nPlaywrite México is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite MX Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite México characteristics\nlink\n\nThis slanted continuous cursive closely mirrors North American models such as Palmer or Zaner-Bloser. The uppercase letters are cursive and include some complex shapes, notably in 'F', 'I', and 'G'. The lowercase letters feature medium-length extenders, with 'f' and 'q' displaying mirrored descender loops that add intricacy. The letter 'z' is designed with a curved top, while 'b', 'v', and 'w' incorporate knots, contributing to the overall ornate style. The construction of the letters is characterized by a slow and complex execution, emphasizing the deliberate and decorative nature of this handwriting style.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite México appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘MX’, Playwrite MX, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in Mexico, see primarium.info/countries/mexico.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer. Navigate to where you saved the font file and double-click it to open. Click the \"Install\" button at the top of the font preview window. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nmacOS: After downloading the font file to your Mac, right-click it in Finder and select \"Open With\" > \"Font Book\". Then, click \"Install Font\" in the font preview window that pops up. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nHow to use the fonts in apps?\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually activated.\n\nNote: This font family doesn't include Bold or Italic styles, so please avoid applying them in text editors. If you use the common 'B' and 'I' buttons, you will automatically generate low-quality styles.\n\nGoogle Docs and Slides: From the font selector drop-down, go to \"More Fonts\" and search for the desired font name, in this case, \"Playwrite MX\", and click OK. If some text is already selected, the font choice will apply.\n\nMicrosoft Word: Go to Format in the Menu bar, select Font, and then the Advanced tab. Activate \"Contextual Alternates\" and \"Kerning for fonts below\" to apply these settings to all text sizes.\n\nLibreOffice: In macOS, to select the different styles, go to Format in the Menu bar, select Character, and use the Typeface menu.\n\nAdobe InDesign: Open the Paragraph Panel and select Adobe \"World-Ready Paragraph Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Illustrator: Navigate to Preferences > Type, check the \"Show Indic Options\" box, and close preferences. Then open the Paragraph Panel and select \"Middle Eastern Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Photoshop: Access the Paragraph Panel, then choose \"World-Ready Layout\" from the contextual menu.\n\nThe above instructions are also available in PDF format here."

    "description": "All Australian provinces employ modern cursive letters for handwriting education, which are taught in a progressive manner. But each state teaches its own version of this style, locally known as ‘script‘, and state-level departments of education offer guidelines and, in some cases, resources for schools and teachers.\n\nThe adoption of the current models and approach can be traced back to 1990, when the Australian Education Council (AEC) recommended that all schools in the country should adopt a handwriting style based on Scottish calligrapher Tom Gourdie’s Simple Modern Hand. The AEC advocated for a consistent style in handwriting instruction across the country so students relocating across states and territories would not face difficulties. Despite starting from the same source, today the five main handwriting models have diverged somewhat in their details.\n\nPlaywrite Australia NSW is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite AU NSW Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Australia NSW characteristics\nlink\n\nThis semi-connected, slanted modern cursive features print-style capital letters. It is characterized by loopless extenders and letters with descenders that do not connect to the following letter. Construction exhibits an overall high stroke speed. Key features include an open 'G' without a crossbar and a uniquely designed 'Y'. The lowercase 'f' is disconnected and has a straight descender. The letters 'b' and 'p' feature closed bowls, enhancing their distinctiveness. Both 'r' and 'z' are presented in an italic style, contributing to the script's elegant and streamlined.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Australia NSW appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘AU’ and a the ‘NSW’ abbreviation Playwrite AU NSW. It features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in australia, see primarium.info/countries/australia.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer. Navigate to where you saved the font file and double-click it to open. Click the \"Install\" button at the top of the font preview window. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nmacOS: After downloading the font file to your Mac, right-click it in Finder and select \"Open With\" > \"Font Book\". Then, click \"Install Font\" in the font preview window that pops up. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nHow to use the fonts in apps?\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually activated.\n\nNote: This font family doesn't include Bold or Italic styles, so please avoid applying them in text editors. If you use the common 'B' and 'I' buttons, you will automatically generate low-quality styles.\n\nGoogle Docs and Slides: From the font selector drop-down, go to \"More Fonts\" and search for the desired font name, in this case, \"Playwrite AU NSW\", and click OK. If some text is already selected, the font choice will apply.\n\nMicrosoft Word: Go to Format in the Menu bar, select Font, and then the Advanced tab. Activate \"Contextual Alternates\" and \"Kerning for fonts below\" to apply these settings to all text sizes.\n\nLibreOffice: In macOS, to select the different styles, go to Format in the Menu bar, select Character, and use the Typeface menu.\n\nAdobe InDesign: Open the Paragraph Panel and select Adobe \"World-Ready Paragraph Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Illustrator: Navigate to Preferences > Type, check the \"Show Indic Options\" box, and close preferences.

    "description": "The ‘écriture cursive’, or traditional vertical cursive, is the most used approach to handwriting teaching in schools in France. Its forms are inspired by the ‘Lettre Ronde’, originally written with a broad nib pen and ink. Students learn ‘écriture cursive‘ by writing letters over Séyès lines, which are introduced during kindergarten (age ~5). Created in 1892, Séyès lines are a system of horizontal and vertical guidelines that govern the proportions of letters, and their ascending and descending strokes.\n\nIn an attempt to reform and modernize handwriting teaching in schools, the Ministère released two digital typeface families in 2013 — Écriture A by Laurence Bedoin-Collard and Heloísa Tissot, and Écriture B, by Marion Andrews. Both fonts follow a modern cursive style and are available for free on the Ministère’s website, along with information for teachers about the shapes and proportions of letters, and how to connect them to form words in the most logical way possible.\n\nPlaywrite France Moderne is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

The capital letters are simplified and print-like, with the only distinctive feature being the raised apex in 'M'. Lowercase letters with descenders, such as 'g' and 'y', do not connect to the following letter, and 'm' and 'n' start without a curved entry stroke. Despite its italic structure, 'b' and 'p' include connecting strokes. The letter 'f' is notable for its descender with a curved stroke.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite France Moderne appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘FR’ and a the word ‘Moderne’, Playwrite FR Moderne.

    "description": "In Vietnam, an official handwriting model for teaching in primary schools was adopted in 2002. It is called the mẫu chữ thảo tiếng việt, or Vietnamese official cursive script, and has been in use from academic year 2002-03 onwards. Based on this model, students learn to write in both upright and (optionally) sloped cursive letters, without ever being taught print letters. Nevertheless, they do practice drawing the basic strokes that make up letters in preparation. Handwriting education happens between Grades 1 to 3, and while students are introduced to writing using a pencil, they graduate to writing with fountain pens while they are still in primary school.\n\nPlaywrite Việt Nam is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite VN Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Việt Nam characteristics\nlink\n\nThe model follows the structure and proportions of the upright, monolinear version of the Vietnamese official cursive script. These are the versions that are prioritized for teaching, while others may be introduced if the situation is conducive. The letter shapes derive from the French traditional vertical cursive writing, featuring long ascenders and descenders and round and fully joined lowercases. Letters 'b', 'r', 'v', and 'w' make use of knots to change the stroke direction, 'n' and 'm' have curved entry strokes and 'x' is created by means of two mirrored curves. Notable upper case features are the triangular yet decorative shapes of 'A', 'V' and 'W', and an 'S' with an upright spine.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Việt Nam appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘VN’, Playwrite VN, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.

    "description": "In The Netherlands, handwriting education commonly begins in Groep 3 after students have learned fine and gross motor skills in previous years.

    "description": "The Austrian Elementary School Curriculum, updated in 2003, stipulates that by the end of the second grade, students should achieve legible and fluent handwriting based on the Österreichische Schulschrift, or Austrian school script. This model was originally created in 1946 drawing upon the foundations of German Sütterlinschrift, but underwent several reforms before its last version was introduced in 1995.\n\nPlaywrite Österreich is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite AT Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Österreich characteristics\nlink\n\nThis cursive style, available in upright and slanted (italic) versions, features oval foundational forms and medium-length extenders. It favors fast writing and it is mostly joined, but some letters with crossbars require pen lifts. Uppercase letters are cursive and semi-joined. Notable shapes include Kurrent-style 't,' an 'f' with a loopless descender, a crossbar in 'Z', and knots in certain lower cases.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Österreich appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘AT’, Playwrite AT, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\n \nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.

    "description": "England has been the incubator for several prominent handwriting styles that still influence teaching around the world. One of the earliest examples is the English Roundhand, which was used in business and education in the 19th century.\n\nThe implementation of modern cursive styles in classrooms is probably the most influential development for contemporary handwriting education. They draw from the ideas of the Italic Handwriting Revival movement of the early 20th century, and the work of its proponents. Alfred Fairbank (1895–1982) proposed modern italic writing, based on chancery models, as a new approach to teaching handwriting with the aim of simplification and faster writing speed. Recently, it has been one of the most popular approaches to handwriting teaching in England. Of the twenty-three methods described in the National Handwriting Association’s 2013 guide to writing methods for teaching, thirteen were fully joined or semi-joined modern cursive styles. Important among these are Nelson Handwriting, Tom Gourdie Modern Hand, Jarman Handwriting, Marion Richardson, and Sassoon-Williams model.\n\nPlaywrite England Joined is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite GB J Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite England Joined characteristics\nlink\n\nThis fully connected modern cursive has short, loopless ascenders and looped descenders, and is available in two flavors: upright and slanted (italic). It has simplified print upper cases. The most identifiable features are the open 'G' with no crossbar and the 'M' with splain legs. Lowercase 'f' is its more recognizable feature, with an ascender that requires lifting the pen. As expected in this style, the letters 'r' and 'z' have an italic cursive structure.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite England Joined appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘GB’ and a ‘J’ for the Joined variant, Playwrite GB J. The font features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\n \nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info, and to learn more about handwriting education in England, see primarium.info/countries/england.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer.

    "description": "In the absence of a unified national approach, elementary education in the United States is supported by several private companies that espouse different approaches to teaching handwriting.

    "description": "All Australian provinces employ modern cursive letters for handwriting education, which are taught in a progressive manner. But each state teaches its own version of this style, locally known as ‘script‘, and state-level departments of education offer guidelines and, in some cases, resources for schools and teachers.\n\nThe adoption of the current models and approach can be traced back to 1990, when the Australian Education Council (AEC) recommended that all schools in the country should adopt a handwriting style based on Scottish calligrapher Tom Gourdie’s Simple Modern Hand. The AEC advocated for a consistent style in handwriting instruction across the country so students relocating across states and territories would not face difficulties. Despite starting from the same source, today the five main handwriting models have diverged somewhat in their details.\n\nPlaywrite Australia Tasmania is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite AU TAS Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Australia Tasmania characteristics\nlink\n\nThis semi-connected, slanted modern cursive features print-style capital letters. The lowercase letters are loopless, and characters with descenders, as well as the letter 's', do not connect to the following letter, allowing for faster writing. The style is characterized by a high stroke speed. Notably, the letter 'G' is open, and 'Y' has a peculiar design. The 'f' is disconnected with a curved descender. The letters 'b' and 'p' have closed bowls, while 'r' and 'z' are presented in an italic style. Additionally, 'q' finishes with a small exit stroke, contributing to the fluidity and distinctiveness of this handwriting style.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Australia Tasmania appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘AU’ and a the ‘TAS’ abbreviation Playwrite AU TAS. It features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in australia, see primarium.info/countries/australia.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer.

    "description": "Through its website, the Department of Basic Education produces and distributes documents that outline curricula, educational goals and guidelines, implementation notes, and assessment policies. The Curriculum Assessment Policy Statements (CAPS) outlines the steps and objectives for handwriting instruction and specifies that students learn motor skills in Grade R, and unjoined upper and lowercase letters in Grade 1. They then gain speed and proficiency in Grade 2, and proceed to cursive writing. The document does not, however, prescribe any handwriting models that should be used for teaching.\n\nDespite the absence of a recommended model, teachers, specialized publishers, and educational resource providers have converged on their choice of fonts for handwriting education. Geometric “ball and stick” letters are used for the first stage of instruction, and a very slanted continuous cursive style is used thereafter.\n\nPlaywrite South Africa is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite ZA Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite South Africa characteristics\nlink\n\nThis continuous cursive features a gentle slope and a relatively slow pace of construction. The uppercase letters incorporate cursive elements, with looped descenders in 'G', 'J', 'Y', and 'Z', enhancing their fluidity. The lowercase letters have looped ascenders and descenders to support seamless connections between letters. Notably, this style does not include curved entry strokes in 'm', 'n', 'v', and 'w', which is a departure from typical continuous cursives. However, it includes distinctly curved shapes in the letters 'x' and 'z', adding a dynamic element to the overall script.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite South Africa appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘ZA’, Playwrite ZA, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.

    "description": "Jacquard is an expanded revival typeface from a Victorian needlepoint alphabet designed in Berlin by Heinrich Kuehn circa 1880.\n\nDesigning typefaces for knitting is essentially the same as creating pixel types. However, in practice, the pixel size is determined by the properties of the yarn in use. Scale is determined by the weight of the yarn as well as the number of pixels that make up the height of each letter. In this collection, the number following the typeface's name indicates the height of the capital letters for that typeface.\n\nThese typefaces were designed with machine knitting in mind, but could be used for hand knitting, needlework, bedazzling, or many other textile crafts.\n\nNote: For Fair Isle knitting, you need to beware of floats and plan accordingly, as always.\n\nEach typeface has a “Regular” and “Charted” version, and some include multiple scales so you can fit type on your knits, no matter the project's size. Check out the non-charted version Jacquard 12.\n\nTo contribute, please see github.com/scfried/soft-type-jacquard."

    "description": "All Australian provinces employ modern cursive letters for handwriting education, which are taught in a progressive manner. But each state teaches its own version of this style, locally known as ‘script‘, and state-level departments of education offer guidelines and, in some cases, resources for schools and teachers.\n\nThe adoption of the current models and approach can be traced back to 1990, when the Australian Education Council (AEC) recommended that all schools in the country should adopt a handwriting style based on Scottish calligrapher Tom Gourdie’s Simple Modern Hand. The AEC advocated for a consistent style in handwriting instruction across the country so students relocating across states and territories would not face difficulties. Despite starting from the same source, today the five main handwriting models have diverged somewhat in their details.\n\nPlaywrite Australia QLD is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite AU QLD Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Australia QLD characteristics\nlink\n\nThis semi-connected, slanted modern cursive features print-style capital letters. The extenders are loopless, and letters with descenders do not connect to the next letter, allowing for a fluid and fast writing pace. Notably, 'm' and 'n' start with curved entry strokes. Distinctive features include an open 'G' without a crossbar and a serifed 'I', adding a unique touch. The 'Y' is peculiar in its form. The lowercase 'f' is disconnected and features a straight descender. The 'q' concludes with a short exit stroke, while the 's' maintains a cursive style. The 'z' is designed to be wide and open with a descender, enhancing readability and style.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Australia QLD appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘AU’ and a the ‘QLD’ abbreviation Playwrite AU QLD. It features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in australia, see primarium.info/countries/australia.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer. Navigate to where you saved the font file and double-click it to open. Click the \"Install\" button at the top of the font preview window. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nmacOS: After downloading the font file to your Mac, right-click it in Finder and select \"Open With\" > \"Font Book\". Then, click \"Install Font\" in the font preview window that pops up. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nHow to use the fonts in apps?\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually activated.\n\nNote: This font family doesn't include Bold or Italic styles, so please avoid applying them in text editors. If you use the common 'B' and 'I' buttons, you will automatically generate low-quality styles.\n\nGoogle Docs and Slides: From the font selector drop-down, go to \"More Fonts\" and search for the desired font name, in this case, \"Playwrite AU QLD\", and click OK. If some text is already selected, the font choice will apply.\n\nMicrosoft Word: Go to Format in the Menu bar, select Font, and then the Advanced tab. Activate \"Contextual Alternates\" and \"Kerning for fonts below\" to apply these settings to all text sizes.\n\nLibreOffice: In macOS, to select the different styles, go to Format in the Menu bar, select Character, and use the Typeface menu.\n\nAdobe InDesign: Open the Paragraph Panel and select Adobe \"World-Ready Paragraph Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Illustrator: Navigate to Preferences > Type, check the \"Show Indic Options\" box, and close preferences. Then open the Paragraph Panel and select \"Middle Eastern Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Photoshop: Access the Paragraph Panel, then choose \"World-Ready Layout\" from the contextual menu.\n\nThe above instructions are also available in PDF format here."

    "description": "The Dutch-French language divide in Belgium, a phenomenon with roots stretching back to the Middle Ages, continues to be relevant in the country today. Traditions of handwriting education exemplify this circumstance and reflect the country's historical ties to France and the Netherlands. Regardless of the handwriting model adopted, students learn print-style script letters in kindergarten and progress to connected letters in primary school. In Flanders, there is a preference for sloped continuous cursive writing, reminiscent of Dutch handwriting models, whereas the French-speaking community in the Walloon region opts for upright cursive writing, a style that enjoys popularity in France. This diversity in handwriting education is a direct response to Belgium's rich linguistic culture, leading to the introduction of a second official language early in the school years.\n\nPlaywrite Belgique Wallonie-Bruxelles is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite BE WAL Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Belgique Wallonie-Bruxelles characteristics\nlink\n\nThis upright cursive style features very long extenders and is executed at a slow speed. The capitals are decorative, with features like crossbars in 'T' and 'Z', and a vertical spine in 'S'. The lowercase letters adhere to a continuous, fully connected cursive style, incorporating loops, knots, and curved entry strokes. Notable details include a flat-topped 'z' with a knot and a 't' with a single-sided crossbar, enhancing the ornate nature of this script.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Belgique Wallonie-Bruxelles appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘BE’ and a the ‘WAL’ abbreviation Playwrite BE WAL. It features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in australia, see primarium.info/countries/belgium.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer. Navigate to where you saved the font file and double-click it to open. Click the \"Install\" button at the top of the font preview window. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nmacOS: After downloading the font file to your Mac, right-click it in Finder and select \"Open With\" > \"Font Book\". Then, click \"Install Font\" in the font preview window that pops up. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nHow to use the fonts in apps?\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually activated.\n\nNote: This font family doesn't include Bold or Italic styles, so please avoid applying them in text editors. If you use the common 'B' and 'I' buttons, you will automatically generate low-quality styles.\n\nGoogle Docs and Slides: From the font selector drop-down, go to \"More Fonts\" and search for the desired font name, in this case, \"Playwrite BE WAL\", and click OK. If some text is already selected, the font choice will apply.\n\nMicrosoft Word: Go to Format in the Menu bar, select Font, and then the Advanced tab. Activate \"Contextual Alternates\" and \"Kerning for fonts below\" to apply these settings to all text sizes.\n\nLibreOffice: In macOS, to select the different styles, go to Format in the Menu bar, select Character, and use the Typeface menu.\n\nAdobe InDesign: Open the Paragraph Panel and select Adobe \"World-Ready Paragraph Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Illustrator: Navigate to Preferences > Type, check the \"Show Indic Options\" box, and close preferences. Then open the Paragraph Panel and select \"Middle Eastern Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Photoshop: Access the Paragraph Panel, then choose \"World-Ready Layout\" from the contextual menu.\n\nThe above instructions are also available in PDF format here."

    "description": "In 2020, the latest iteration of the Rámcový Učebný Plán, or Framework Curriculum, was published by the Ministerstvo. It provides a sample of fully-joined, cursive writing based on ‘Zjednodušená psací latinka‘, or Simplified Latin script, which was ratified by the government of erstwhile Czechoslovakia in 1932. According to the curriculum, students must learn to write based on this model, following its letter shapes as well as slant.\n\nThe Ministerstvo has been sharing this model with private publishers since 1993, and in the absence of official digitization, publishers have produced their own versions for use in their textbooks. Until 2020, schools only received government funding for purchasing textbooks if they did so from state-verified publishers, though that is no longer the case.\n\nPlaywrite Slovensko is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite SK Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Slovensko characteristics\nlink\n\nThis slanted continuous cursive features medium to short extenders and is executed at a slow stroke speed. The capital letters maintain a cursive, mostly unadorned structure, with distinctive traits such as an unusually constructed 'Q' and a vertical spine in 'S'. Lowercase letters have loops on extenders but lack knots, with the exception of the German-style 't'. Several lowercase letters begin with curved entry strokes. The letter 'z' is styled in a plain italic form and does not have a descender.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Slovensko appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘SK’, Playwrite SK, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.

    "description": "Due to the absence of handwriting education guidelines in the curriculum and no prescribed model, there is a great deal of diversity in the approaches to handwriting teaching. The most widespread method is to teach uppercase print-style letters first and connected cursive writing second. However, in some schools, students may start with cursive writing in the first grade itself, and in others, cursive writing is not taught at all. An important difference is seen in private schools, where handwriting may be taught using models imported from abroad. For instance, Spanish-English bilingual schools teach using the Sassoon model that was developed in England.\n\nPlaywrite Perú is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite PE Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Perú characteristics\nlink\n\nThis upright continuous cursive handwriting model features medium-length ascenders and descenders. The capital letters are cursive and include a few complex shapes, notably in 'F', 'R', and 'O'. The letter 'G' is distinctive, appearing to be influenced by American styles rather than the traditional French vertical cursives. The lowercase letters have looped extenders and showcase a unique two-stroke construction of 'k'. The letter 'f' is characterized by a straight descender, while 'v' and 'w' are noted for their knots, adding to the distinctiveness of this cursive style.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Peru appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘PE’, Playwrite PE, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in Peru, see primarium.info/countries/peru.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer.

    "description": "Even though writing may be introduced in preschool, systematic teaching of handwriting only happens in the 1° Cycle. Since schools have pedagogic autonomy in Portugal, there are differences in how handwriting is taught. However, it should be noted that they must meet the curriculum goals set out by the government and are subject to periodic external evaluations. Schools usually begin with ‘letra impressa’, or print script letters, starting with capital letters for students aged 5–6 years old, before moving to a fully joined, vertical cursive writing, known as ‘escrita vertical’. There are also some traditional schools that start handwriting teaching with letra de mão/manuscrita, or cursive letters from the beginning.\n\nPlaywrite Portugal is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

    "description": "In Nigeria, there is an emphasis on students receiving instruction in the language they hear and use every day. This poses a challenge in a country with limited resources and great linguistic diversity. Apart from four widely spoken languages — Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba and English — there are hundreds of regional languages as well as dialects. As a result, teacher training and educational resources are required for several languages.\n\nIn the past, before the widespread use of computers, there was greater emphasis on handwriting. Today, while private schools with more resources may adopt foreign models like Nelson Handwriting, public schools face financial constraints, impacting their ability to prioritize handwriting education.

    "description": "All Australian provinces employ modern cursive letters for handwriting education, which are taught in a progressive manner. But each state teaches its own version of this style, locally known as ‘script‘, and state-level departments of education offer guidelines and, in some cases, resources for schools and teachers.\n\nThe adoption of the current models and approach can be traced back to 1990, when the Australian Education Council (AEC) recommended that all schools in the country should adopt a handwriting style based on Scottish calligrapher Tom Gourdie’s Simple Modern Hand. The AEC advocated for a consistent style in handwriting instruction across the country so students relocating across states and territories would not face difficulties. Despite starting from the same source, today the five main handwriting models have diverged somewhat in their details.\n\nPlaywrite Australia Victoria is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite AU VIC Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Australia Victoria characteristics\nlink\n\nThis modern cursive includes elements of continuous cursive styles, such as the open bowls in 'b' and 'p'. The only loop is on the ascender of 'f', while 'm' and 'n' feature curved entry strokes. Letters with descenders, except for 'f', do not connect to the next letter, giving a more distinct and clear semi-connected appearance. The 'z' has a very open design with a descender. In line with other Australian models, 'g' also features an open design. 'M' is noted for its plain legs, and 'q' ends with a small exit stroke.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Australia Victoria appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘AU’ and a the ‘VIC’ abbreviation Playwrite AU VIC. It features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in australia, see primarium.info/countries/australia.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer. Navigate to where you saved the font file and double-click it to open. Click the \"Install\" button at the top of the font preview window. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nmacOS: After downloading the font file to your Mac, right-click it in Finder and select \"Open With\" > \"Font Book\". Then, click \"Install Font\" in the font preview window that pops up.

    "description": "The curriculum goals for Comunicare în limba română, or Communication in the Romanian language, place importance on teaching handwriting. Instruction happens during the early years of primary education, specifically in preparatory, first, and second grades. While schools and teachers have some flexibility in their methods, the instruction process, its stages, and writing models are widely standardized.\n\nHandwriting education begins in preparatory grade with a focus on print script alphabet, also known as ‘scris de tipar‘ or ‘litere bloc’, and on development of communication skills. In first grade, students gradually transition to a cursive writing model called ‘litere de mână‘. It is a continuous cursive style with a 18º slope, and its narrow proportions follow a grid.\n\nPlaywrite România is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite RO Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite România characteristics\nlink\n\nThis slanted continuous cursive features a slow stroke speed and medium-length looped ascenders and descenders. The uppercase letters are decorative, highlighted by a straight spine in 'S' and a distinguishable shape in 'G'. Both capital and lowercase versions of 'X' and 'Z' include crossbars as a unifying stylistic element. The lowercase letters often incorporate knots, enhancing the complex appearance of the script. The letter 'f' has a loopless descender and connects to the next letter via its crossbar, while 'q' is notable for a short exit stroke in its descender.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Romania appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘RO’, Playwrite RO, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.

    "description": "The Colombian cursive style ‘letra pegada’ is visibly rooted in the traditions of the Palmer method, created by Austin Palmer (1860–1927) in the United States at the turn of the last century. It has many similarities with cursive writing models in North American countries ( United States, México, and Canada), which also descend from the same style. This influence can be seen in the ‘cartillas’ or handwriting education booklets produced by private publishers, which play an essential role in the teaching of reading and writing in the country.\n\nPlaywrite Colombia is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite CO Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Colombia characteristics\nlink\n\nFollowing the tradition and current use of these booklets, Playwrite Colombia is a very slanted continuous cursive. Its lowercase letters have medium-length ascenders and descenders with loops that favor writing whole words without pen lifts. Based on the Palmer style, these loops are mirrored in the descending strokes of letters 'f' and 'q'. Some uppercase letters, such as the 'G', 'L' and 'Z', have decorative and complex cursive shapes.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Colombia appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘CO’, Playwrite CO, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in Colombia, see primarium.info/countries/colombia.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer. Navigate to where you saved the font file and double-click it to open. Click the \"Install\" button at the top of the font preview window. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nmacOS: After downloading the font file to your Mac, right-click it in Finder and select \"Open With\" > \"Font Book\". Then, click \"Install Font\" in the font preview window that pops up. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nHow to use the fonts in apps?\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually activated.\n\nNote: This font family doesn't include Bold or Italic styles, so please avoid applying them in text editors. If you use the common 'B' and 'I' buttons, you will automatically generate low-quality styles.\n\nGoogle Docs and Slides: From the font selector drop-down, go to \"More Fonts\" and search for the desired font name, in this case, \"Playwrite CO\", and click OK. If some text is already selected, the font choice will apply.\n\nMicrosoft Word: Go to Format in the Menu bar, select Font, and then the Advanced tab. Activate \"Contextual Alternates\" and \"Kerning for fonts below\" to apply these settings to all text sizes.\n\nLibreOffice: In macOS, to select the different styles, go to Format in the Menu bar, select Character, and use the Typeface menu.\n\nAdobe InDesign: Open the Paragraph Panel and select Adobe \"World-Ready Paragraph Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Illustrator: Navigate to Preferences > Type, check the \"Show Indic Options\" box, and close preferences.

    "description": "Primary school handwriting in Spain features letters that are cursive from a structural standpoint but have no slant.

    "description": "The most prevalent style of handwriting taught in Chile is known as ‘letra ligada’, or joined letters. This form of cursive handwriting is introduced to children as early as 6 years old, either alongside print letters or as a standalone style. It can be seen as a slantless variant of English roundhand, a calligraphic style that emerged in England, gaining widespread popularity in the 18th century, but Chilean type designers note that, while there are structural similarities between the two styles, there are also notable differences.

    "description": "The NCAA publishes the national curriculum, and issues of language are dealt with in the “Primary Language Curriculum”, which was last published in 2019. This document is fully bilingual in English and Irish Gaelic. An additional guideline document for teachers called ”Primary Language Curriculum. Support Material for teachers. Writing”, is also published by the NCAA. This devotes a full section to handwriting and suggests that children can be introduced to cursive writing as early as the junior infant level.\n\nIn practice, however, each school can choose its own methods for teaching handwriting. Most teachers start with either print script (locally called “manuscript”) or precursive letters in junior and senior infant levels. From Class 1 onwards, students are taught to add exit strokes to letters and then connect them to achieve a cursive hand.\n\nPlaywrite Ireland is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite IE Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Ireland characteristics\nlink\n\nThis model showcases a sloped, continuous cursive style where uppercase letters connect to the following letter whenever possible. The letter 'H' is notable for its distinctive crossbar shape. Unlike other models in this category, lowercase letters have short extenders with loops but do not start with curved entry strokes. The construction of the bowls in 'b' and 'p' differs significantly from each other. The letter 'z' features a curved top and a looped descender.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Ireland appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘IE’, Playwrite IE, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in Ireland, see primarium.info/countries/ireland.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer.

    "description": "In Germany, education is regulated at the state level rather than at the national level. Each state defines its own models and methods of teaching handwriting in primary schools. The common goal is acquiring a personal style of connected handwriting at the end of primary school in fourth grade (10-11 years old). Emphasis is on the flow of connected writing, letter recognition, and legibility, not the exact imitation of individual letters.\n\nIn most states, teachers and schools can choose from three cursive styles: Ausgangsschrift (LA), Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift (VA), and Schulausgangsschrift (SAS). But in 2010, the Grundschulverband, or Association of Primary Schools, presented an alternative progressive approach for handwriting teaching: Grundschrift, based primarily on a print-style script with some added cursive elements, like Häckchen, or exit strokes. Some German states, like Bremen and Hamburg, allow this method to be used in schools, in addition to the dominant Ausgangschrift systems. According to Das Deutsche Schulportal, Grundschrift is taught in 10% of all German schools.\n\nPlaywrite Deutschland Lateinische Ausgangsschrift is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite DE LA Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Deutschland Lateinische Ausgangsschrift characteristics\nlink\n\nThis style is a very slanted continuous cursive with slightly decorative uppercase letters. Notably, 'A' includes a looped bar, 'S' has a straight spine, 'Z' features a crossbar, and 'X' showcases a double loop, allowing it to be drawn in a single fluid movement, similar to its lowercase counterpart. The lowercase letters have short ascenders and descenders, most with loops facilitating continuous writing. Letters 'm', 'n', 'r', 'v', 'w' begin with curved entry strokes, while 'r' and 'z' display an italic structure. The letter 'f' is characterized by an ascender loop and a straight descender.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Deutschland Lateinische Ausgangsschrift appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘DE’ and a the ‘LA‘ abbreviation, Playwrite DE LA. It features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.

    "description": "Jaini Purva and Jaini (both Devanagari) are typefaces based on the calligraphic style of the Jain Kalpasutra manuscripts, particularly referencing a manuscript from 1503 CE. The manuscript style has several unique features not seen in the commonly observed Balbodh style. These include a disconnected shirorekha with triangular wedges, short upper matras, squarish letters with large kana height, heavy knots, and the integration of lower matras within the kana height. It also contains some letter-shapes that have evolved over time and are not familiar to current readers. In an attempt to revive the distinct calligraphic style for contemporary use, Jaini adapts visual features of the manuscript style to contemporary letter-structures. Jaini and Jaini Purva differ in their treatment of conjuncts; Jaini adheres to contemporary conventions of horizontal conjuncts, whereas Jaini Purva stays true to vertically stacked conjuncts as seen in manuscripts.\n\nWhile Jaini Devanagari references past manuscripts, its Latin companion draws inspiration from a hand-lettering style seen in present-day India. In regions where Devanagari is predominantly used, it is not uncommon to see Latin letterforms drawn with a Devanagari pen angle (which is almost perpendicular to the Latin pen angle) with a subtle hint of a shirorekha. Jaini (Latin) draws inspiration from this street style while visually matching it with the wavy stems and squarish counters of Jaini Devanagari.\n\nJaini Devanagari was designed in 2016 by Girish Dalvi and Maithili Shingre. Jaini Latin was designed in 2023 by Taresh Vohra. This project is led by Ek Type, a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces.\n\nTo contribute to the project, see github.com/EkType/Jaini"

    "description": "The primary school curriculum, published by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, and the Tanzania Institute of Education (TIE), was last updated in 2015. The first section, centered on the first two years of primary education (Standards 1 and 2) focuses on developing competencies in reading, writing and arithmetic. The TIE also publishes a syllabus that provides specific guidelines for the implementation of the curriculum. The syllabus states that students should learn print style letters first followed by cursive writing, but no models or samples are shown.\n\nIn practice, Standard 1 students learn an almost upright precursive and progress to a fully-joined cursive from Standard 2 onwards. The primers available through the free online library services supply detailed samples and practice materials that are used in classrooms.\n\nPlaywrite Tanzania is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite TZ Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Tanzania characteristics\nlink\n\nThis sloped continuous cursive style includes decorative capital letters. 'A' and 'H' feature looped crossbars, while 'G' has a cursive structure but lacks a descending stroke. 'M' and 'N' are constructed differently, with only one following a cursive format.

    "description": "In Germany, education is regulated at the state level rather than at the national level. Each state defines its own models and methods of teaching handwriting in primary schools. The common goal is acquiring a personal style of connected handwriting at the end of primary school in fourth grade (10-11 years old). Emphasis is on the flow of connected writing, letter recognition, and legibility, not the exact imitation of individual letters.\n\nIn most states, teachers and schools can choose from three cursive styles: Ausgangsschrift (LA), Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift (VA), and Schulausgangsschrift (SAS). But in 2010, the Grundschulverband, or Association of Primary Schools, presented an alternative progressive approach for handwriting teaching: Grundschrift, based primarily on a print-style script with some added cursive elements, like Häckchen, or exit strokes. Some German states, like Bremen and Hamburg, allow this method to be used in schools, in addition to the dominant Ausgangschrift systems. According to Das Deutsche Schulportal, Grundschrift is taught in 10% of all German schools.\n\nPlaywrite Deutschland Schulausgangschrift is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite DE SAS Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Deutschland Schulausgangschrift characteristics\nlink\n\nThis continuous cursive features a medium slope, short extenders, and a deliberately slow stroke speed. The capital letters present a restrained appearance, with only a few exhibiting decorative or cursive traits. The lowercase letters have looped ascenders and descenders, and 'm', 'n', and 'r' begin with a curved entry stroke. This typeface displays a German-style 't' that can be executed without lifting the pen. The letter 'f' has a straight and loopless descender, while 'r' and 'z' are designed with an italic structure.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Deutschland Schulausgangschrift appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘DE’ and a the ‘SAS’ abbreviation Playwrite DE SAS. It features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in Germany, see primarium.info/countries/germany.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer. Navigate to where you saved the font file and double-click it to open. Click the \"Install\" button at the top of the font preview window. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nmacOS: After downloading the font file to your Mac, right-click it in Finder and select \"Open With\" > \"Font Book\". Then, click \"Install Font\" in the font preview window that pops up. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nHow to use the fonts in apps?\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually activated.\n\nNote: This font family doesn't include Bold or Italic styles, so please avoid applying them in text editors. If you use the common 'B' and 'I' buttons, you will automatically generate low-quality styles.\n\nGoogle Docs and Slides: From the font selector drop-down, go to \"More Fonts\" and search for the desired font name, in this case, \"Playwrite DE SAS\", and click OK. If some text is already selected, the font choice will apply.\n\nMicrosoft Word: Go to Format in the Menu bar, select Font, and then the Advanced tab. Activate \"Contextual Alternates\" and \"Kerning for fonts below\" to apply these settings to all text sizes.\n\nLibreOffice: In macOS, to select the different styles, go to Format in the Menu bar, select Character, and use the Typeface menu.\n\nAdobe InDesign: Open the Paragraph Panel and select Adobe \"World-Ready Paragraph Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Illustrator: Navigate to Preferences > Type, check the \"Show Indic Options\" box, and close preferences.

    "description": "Jacquard is an expanded revival typeface from a Victorian needlepoint alphabet designed in Berlin by Heinrich Kuehn circa 1880.\n\nDesigning typefaces for knitting is essentially the same as creating pixel types. However, in practice, the pixel size is determined by the properties of the yarn in use. Scale is determined by the weight of the yarn as well as the number of pixels that make up the height of each letter. In this collection, the number following the typeface's name indicates the height of the capital letters for that typeface.\n\nThese typefaces were designed with machine knitting in mind, but could be used for hand knitting, needlework, bedazzling, or many other textile crafts.\n\nNote: For Fair Isle knitting, you need to beware of floats and plan accordingly, as always.\n\nEach typeface has a “Regular” and “Charted” version, and some include multiple scales so you can fit type on your knits, no matter the project's size. Check out the non-charted version Jacquard 24 .\n\nTo contribute, please see github.com/scfried/soft-type-jacquard ."

    "description": "In Norway, the most prevalent form of handwriting in education is the stavskrift. It is an unlooped modern cursive style that borrows elements from continuous cursive writing.

    "description": "Italy holds an important place in the historical development of handwriting styles. Handwriting produced in the Latin script finds its roots in the models produced during the Italian Renaissance. The most prevalent form of handwriting taught in Italy is an upright cursive style developed in the early to mid-20th century, which, according to handwriting expert Francesco Ascoli, was prescribed in the country’s national guidelines in 1945.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, the decline in the quality of handwriting in Italy caught the attention of the educational community. To rectify this situation, educators and handwriting experts started to explore different ways to improve instruction in primary schools by revamping approaches and resources for traditional handwriting education or introducing new teaching schemes. The Scrittura Corsiva modern cursive project has gained significant recognition among the latter.\n\nPlaywrite Italia Tradizionale is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite IT Trad Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Italia Tradizionale characteristics\nlink\n\nThis upright, fully joined, modern cursive features short ascenders and descenders. It utilizes simplified print-style capital letters. Distinctive identity traits include a serifed 'I' and an 'M' with splain legs. Lowercase letters 'f', 'g', 'j', and 'y' employ descender loops to connect to the next letter seamlessly. Both 'p' and 'b' are designed with closed bowls, 'k' is constructed with two strokes, and 'f' is notable for the absence of its top loop, creating a recognizable handwriting model.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Italia Tradizionale appears in font menus with a two-letter country code, ‘IT’ and a the ‘Trad’ abbreviation, Playwrite IT Trad. It features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.\nThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts for each style.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in Italy, see primarium.info/countries/italy.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer. Navigate to where you saved the font file and double-click it to open. Click the \"Install\" button at the top of the font preview window. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nmacOS: After downloading the font file to your Mac, right-click it in Finder and select \"Open With\" > \"Font Book\". Then, click \"Install Font\" in the font preview window that pops up. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nHow to use the fonts in apps?\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually activated.\n\nNote: This font family doesn't include Bold or Italic styles, so please avoid applying them in text editors. If you use the common 'B' and 'I' buttons, you will automatically generate low-quality styles.\n\nGoogle Docs and Slides: From the font selector drop-down, go to \"More Fonts\" and search for the desired font name, in this case, \"Playwrite IT Trad\", and click OK. If some text is already selected, the font choice will apply.\n\nMicrosoft Word: Go to Format in the Menu bar, select Font, and then the Advanced tab. Activate \"Contextual Alternates\" and \"Kerning for fonts below\" to apply these settings to all text sizes.\n\nLibreOffice: In macOS, to select the different styles, go to Format in the Menu bar, select Character, and use the Typeface menu.\n\nAdobe InDesign: Open the Paragraph Panel and select Adobe \"World-Ready Paragraph Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Illustrator: Navigate to Preferences > Type, check the \"Show Indic Options\" box, and close preferences. Then open the Paragraph Panel and select \"Middle Eastern Composer\" from the contextual menu.\n\nAdobe Photoshop: Access the Paragraph Panel, then choose \"World-Ready Layout\" from the contextual menu.\n\nThe above instructions are also available in PDF format here."

This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.\n\nThe primary school curriculum, published by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, and the Tanzania Institute of Education (TIE), was last updated in 2015. The first section, centered on the first two years of primary education (Standards 1 and 2) focuses on developing competencies in reading, writing and arithmetic. The TIE also publishes a syllabus that provides specific guidelines for the implementation of the curriculum. The syllabus states that students should learn print style letters first followed by cursive writing, but no models or samples are shown.\n\nIn practice, Standard 1 students learn an almost upright precursive and progress to a fully-joined cursive from Standard 2 onwards. The primers available through the free online library services supply detailed samples and practice materials that are used in classrooms.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Tanzania Guides characteristics\nlink\n\nGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing.

This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.\n\nEducational Vertical cursive models first appeared in the 19th century in France, England, and the USA as simplified forms of their predecessors, Roundhand and Spencerian styles, respectively. The upright cursive writing did not enjoy a long period of popularity in northern European and Anglo-American countries. It was, however, widely adopted in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and France, where it is still used. From these countries, it traveled to erstwhile colonies such as Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, among others.

    "description": "Playwrite Magyarország Guides is a single-weight font designed to harmonize seamlessly with its companion, Playwrite Magyarország. This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.\n\nThe most recent version of the National Core Curriculum, published in 2020, describes exercises aimed at preparing students for writing and emphasizes the acquisition of reading skills and comprehension. It does not mention any models for handwriting instruction. However, an official teacher’s manual called Tanítói Kézikönyv prescribes the use of workbooks published by the Minisztere through its Oktatási Hivatal, or Educational Authority.\n\nThere are several handwriting instruction books in the catalog. Among them, the most popular series are Írás Munkafüzet and Betubarangolo, both edited by the staff of the Oktatási Hivatal and with visual and typographic design by László Kajtár. These publications follow the most common approach used in handwriting education in Hungary: both print and cursive letters are introduced from first grade, and the cursive letters are upright, wide, round, and have looped extenders.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Magyarország Guides characteristics\nlink\n\nGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing. To create a versatile font for teachers designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. It replaces the glyph shape with the guidelines and matches the width of the letter space.\n\nFind the detailed characteristics of this country's Model in Playwrite Magyarország.\n\nFamily name in font menus\nlink\n\nPlaywrite Magyarország Guides appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘HU’, Playwrite HU Guides, and features a single Regular weight.\nThe download .zip file includes the static font for this guided version.\n\nPlaywrite fonts for schools\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by Playpen Sans, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.\n\nFor more information about the Primarium project, visit primarium.info and to learn more about handwriting education in Tanzania, see primarium.info/countries/hungary.\n\nHow to install the fonts?\nlink\n\nWindows: Download the font file to your computer. Navigate to where you saved the font file and double-click it to open. Click the \"Install\" button at the top of the font preview window. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nmacOS: After downloading the font file to your Mac, right-click it in Finder and select \"Open With\" > \"Font Book\". Then, click \"Install Font\" in the font preview window that pops up. The font is now installed and ready to be used across your apps.\n\nHow to use the fonts in apps?\nlink\n\nThe Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually activated.\n\nNote: This font family doesn't include Bold or Italic styles, so please avoid applying them in text editors. If you use the common 'B' and 'I' buttons, you will automatically generate low-quality styles.\n\nGoogle Docs and Slides: From the font selector drop-down, go to \"More Fonts\" and search for the desired font name, in this case, \"Playwrite HU Guides\", and click OK.

The upright cursive writing did not enjoy a long period of popularity in northern European and Anglo-American countries.

From these countries, it traveled to erstwhile colonies such as Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, among others.

    "description": "The ‘écriture cursive’, or traditional vertical cursive, is the most used approach to handwriting teaching in schools in France. Its forms are inspired by the ‘Lettre Ronde’, originally written with a broad nib pen and ink. Students learn ‘écriture cursive‘ by writing letters over Séyès lines, which are introduced during kindergarten (age ~5). Created in 1892, Séyès lines are a system of horizontal and vertical guidelines that govern the proportions of letters, and their ascending and descending strokes.\n\nIn an attempt to reform and modernize handwriting teaching in schools, the Ministère released two digital typeface families in 2013 — Écriture A by Laurence Bedoin-Collard and Heloísa Tissot, and Écriture B, by Marion Andrews. Both fonts follow a modern cursive style and are available for free on the Ministère’s website, along with information for teachers about the shapes and proportions of letters, and how to connect them to form words in the most logical way possible.\n\nPlaywrite France Traditionnelle is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages. It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, Playwrite FR Trad Guides, designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a visual aid for primary school children.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite France Traditionnelle characteristics\nlink\n\nClosely following the Écriture Droite structure, this upright continuous cursive showcases very long ascenders and descenders and is characterized by round shapes that are executed slowly. The uppercase letters are decorative, with some, like 'R' and 'Y', designed to facilitate connections to subsequent letters. The lowercase 'f' features a mirrored bottom loop.

Students are taught uppercase and lowercase letters in trykkskrift, a simplified print script, in the first grade. In the middle of the second or beginning of the third grade, they are introduced to stavskrift and learn joining strokes between letters.

This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.\n\nIn Vietnam, an official handwriting model for teaching in primary schools was adopted in 2002. It is called the mẫu chữ thảo tiếng việt, or Vietnamese official cursive script, and has been in use from academic year 2002-03 onwards. Based on this model, students learn to write in both upright and (optionally) sloped cursive letters, without ever being taught print letters. Nevertheless, they do practice drawing the basic strokes that make up letters in preparation. Handwriting education happens between Grades 1 to 3, and while students are introduced to writing using a pencil, they graduate to writing with fountain pens while they are still in primary school.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Việt Nam Guides characteristics\nlink\n\nGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing.

Handwriting produced in the Latin script finds its roots in the models produced during the Italian Renaissance. The most prevalent form of handwriting taught in Italy is an upright cursive style developed in the early to mid-20th century, which, according to handwriting expert Francesco Ascoli, was prescribed in the country’s national guidelines in 1945.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, the decline in the quality of handwriting in Italy caught the attention of the educational community. To rectify this situation, educators and handwriting experts started to explore different ways to improve instruction in primary schools by revamping approaches and resources for traditional handwriting education, or introducing new teaching schemes.

This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.\n\nEngland has been the incubator for several prominent handwriting styles that still influence teaching around the world. One of the earliest examples is the English Roundhand, which was used in business and education in the 19th century.\n\nThe implementation of modern cursive styles in classrooms is probably the most influential development for contemporary handwriting education. They draw from the ideas of the Italic Handwriting Revival movement of the early 20th century, and the work of its proponents. Alfred Fairbank (1895–1982) proposed modern italic writing, based on chancery models, as a new approach to teaching handwriting with the aim of simplification and faster writing speed. Recently, it has been one of the most popular approaches to handwriting teaching in England. Of the twenty-three methods described in the National Handwriting Association’s 2013 guide to writing methods for teaching, thirteen were fully joined or semi-joined modern cursive styles. Important among these are Nelson Handwriting, Tom Gourdie Modern Hand, Jarman Handwriting, Marion Richardson, and Sassoon-Williams model.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite England Joined Guides characteristics\nlink\n\nGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing.

These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.\n\nIn Germany, education is regulated at the state level rather than at the national level. Each state defines its own models and methods of teaching handwriting in primary schools. The common goal is acquiring a personal style of connected handwriting at the end of primary school in fourth grade (10-11 years old). Emphasis is on the flow of connected writing, letter recognition, and legibility, not the exact imitation of individual letters.\n\nIn most states, teachers and schools can choose from three cursive styles: Ausgangsschrift (LA), Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift (VA), and Schulausgangsschrift (SAS). But in 2010, the Grundschulverband, or Association of Primary Schools, presented an alternative progressive approach for handwriting teaching: Grundschrift, based primarily on a print-style script with some added cursive elements, like Häckchen, or exit strokes. Some German states, like Bremen and Hamburg, allow this method to be used in schools, in addition to the dominant Ausgangschrift systems. According to Das Deutsche Schulportal, Grundschrift is taught in 10% of all German schools.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Deutschland Lateinische Ausgangsschrift Guides characteristics\nlink\n\nGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing.

Its forms are inspired by the ‘Lettre Ronde’, originally written with a broad nib pen and ink. Students learn ‘écriture cursive‘ by writing letters over Séyès lines, which are introduced during kindergarten (age ~5). Created in 1892, Séyès lines are a system of horizontal and vertical guidelines that govern the proportions of letters, and their ascending and descending strokes.\n\nIn an attempt to reform and modernize handwriting teaching in schools, the Ministère released two digital typeface families in 2013 — Écriture A by Laurence Bedoin-Collard and Heloísa Tissot, and Écriture B, by Marion Andrews. Both fonts follow a modern cursive style and are available for free on the Ministère’s website, along with information for teachers about the shapes and proportions of letters, and how to connect them to form words in the most logical way possible.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite France Traditionnelle characteristics\nlink\n\nGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing.

    "description": "Playwrite Australia NSW Guides is a single-weight font designed to harmonize seamlessly with its companion, Playwrite Australia NSW. This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.\n\nAll Australian provinces employ modern cursive letters for handwriting education, which are taught in a progressive manner. But each state teaches its own version of this style, locally known as ‘script‘, and state-level departments of education offer guidelines and, in some cases, resources for schools and teachers.\n\nThe adoption of the current models and approach can be traced back to 1990, when the Australian Education Council (AEC) recommended that all schools in the country should adopt a handwriting style based on Scottish calligrapher Tom Gourdie’s Simple Modern Hand. The AEC advocated for a consistent style in handwriting instruction across the country so students relocating across states and territories would not face difficulties. Despite starting from the same source, today the five main handwriting models have diverged somewhat in their details.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Australia NSW Guides characteristics\nlink\n\nGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing. To create a versatile font for teachers designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character.

The book for grade 1 teaches students print-style letterforms. No cursive writing instruction appears in this or the grade 2 textbook. However, NCERT’s previous English textbook series, called Marigold, focused on cursive writing in grade 2 (7–8 years old) and showed samples in a style similar to one developed by Irish-born British diplomat, Vere Foster, in the second half of the nineteenth century. Further, handwriting textbooks produced by a major private publisher directly attribute the samples in their volumes to Foster’s model.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite India Guides characteristics\nlink\n\nGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing.

These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.\n\nItaly holds an important place in the historical development of handwriting styles. Handwriting produced in the Latin script finds its roots in the models produced during the Italian Renaissance. The most prevalent form of handwriting taught in Italy is an upright cursive style developed in the early to mid-20th century, which, according to handwriting expert Francesco Ascoli, was prescribed in the country’s national guidelines in 1945.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, the decline in the quality of handwriting in Italy caught the attention of the educational community. To rectify this situation, educators and handwriting experts started to explore different ways to improve instruction in primary schools by revamping approaches and resources for traditional handwriting education or introducing new teaching schemes. The Scrittura Corsiva modern cursive project has gained significant recognition among the latter.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Italia Tradizionale characteristics\nlink\n\nGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing.

One of the earliest examples is the English Roundhand, which was used in business and education in the 19th century.\n\nThe implementation of modern cursive styles in classrooms is probably the most influential development for contemporary handwriting education. They draw from the ideas of the Italic Handwriting Revival movement of the early 20th century, and the work of its proponents. Alfred Fairbank (1895–1982) proposed modern italic writing, based on chancery models, as a new approach to teaching handwriting with the aim of simplification and faster writing speed. Recently, it has been one of the most popular approaches to handwriting teaching in England. Of the twenty-three methods described in the National Handwriting Association’s 2013 guide to writing methods for teaching, thirteen were fully joined or semi-joined modern cursive styles. Important among these are Nelson Handwriting, Tom Gourdie Modern Hand, Jarman Handwriting, Marion Richardson, and Sassoon-Williams model.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite England SemiJoined Guides characteristics\nlink\n\nGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing.

These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.\n\nThe latest edition of the national curriculum, published in 2014, requires that at the end of fourth grade, students must “write all the letters, write clearly and understandably.” Handwriting teaching in Iceland happens during grades 1-3 (6-9 years old), and books by the MMS adhere to a progressive system based on simplified modern italic styles.\n\nAccording to this system, students should first be introduced to the lowercase letters of Grunnskrift or the initial model. These are simplified and unconnected letters, slightly slanted and with exit strokes. This should be followed by uppercase letters of the same model. Finally, in the third grade (8-9 years old), students learn Tengiskrift or joined letters.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Ísland characteristics\nlink\n\nGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing.

These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.\n\nIn Germany, education is regulated at the state level rather than at the national level. Each state defines its own models and methods of teaching handwriting in primary schools. The common goal is acquiring a personal style of connected handwriting at the end of primary school in fourth grade (10-11 years old). Emphasis is on the flow of connected writing, letter recognition, and legibility, not the exact imitation of individual letters.\n\nIn most states, teachers and schools can choose from three cursive styles: Ausgangsschrift (LA), Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift (VA), and Schulausgangsschrift (SAS). But in 2010, the Grundschulverband, or Association of Primary Schools, presented an alternative progressive approach for handwriting teaching: Grundschrift, based primarily on a print-style script with some added cursive elements, like Häckchen, or exit strokes. Some German states, like Bremen and Hamburg, allow this method to be used in schools, in addition to the dominant Ausgangschrift systems. According to Das Deutsche Schulportal, Grundschrift is taught in 10% of all German schools.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Deutschland Schulausgangschrift Guides characteristics\nlink\n\nGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing.

    "description": "Playwrite Česko Guides is a single-weight font designed to harmonize seamlessly with its companion, Playwrite Česko. This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.\n\nThere are two main models used for handwriting education in the Czech Republic. The first, known as Zjednodušená psací latinka, or Simplified Latin script, is a continuous cursive hand. This model was officially ratified by the education ministry of erstwhile Czechoslovakia in 1932 and underwent its last revision in 1978. The second model, Comenia Script, features unjoined letters and was endorsed by the ministry in 2012. The national curriculum, which was last published in 2013, provides no further prescriptions about handwriting, and as a result, schools have the autonomy to select either model for instruction.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Česko Guides characteristics\nlink\n\nGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing.

    "description": "Playwrite Argentina Guides is a single-weight font companion that harmonizes seamlessly with the main family, Playwrite Argentina. It includes guidelines on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders. These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.\n\nPrimary school curricula in Argentina focus on writing mostly from a comprehension and composition standpoint rather than from the perspective of handwriting. Even so, primary school students learn how to write with joined upright cursive letters from first or second grade. In the initial level, students learn print-style uppercase letters, followed by print lowercase letters in the first grade, and finally, cursive writing.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\nPlaywrite Argentina Guides characteristics\nlink\n\nGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter/word spacing.
